&quot; The potential productivity gains should be considerable .
Today , QuarkXPress ® 8 has tighter integration with Photoshop ® and Illustrator ® than ever before , and through standards like HTML and CSS , QuarkXPress users can publish across media both independently and alongside Adobe ® Creative Suite ® applications like Adobe Flash ® ( SWF ) and Adobe Dreamweaver ® .
Here , you ’ ll find out how Creative Suite users can get the best possible interaction with QuarkXPress .
You ’ ll be surprised how easy Quark has made it to unlock the full potential of all your design software .
QuarkXPress 8 is considered by many to have the best integration with Photoshop ’ s PSD file format of any layout tool available today .
In this section we ’ ll explain when you should use the PSD format for your images and how to get the most out of them .
For example , you may have multiple layers in your PSD with different product shots , which will vary from publication to publication .
If you use PSD , you can switch those layers on or off in QuarkXPress without having to save a separate TIFF for each publication .
Another question that might tip you in favor of PSD is , &quot; Do I need to use a spot color with this image ?
&quot; Using spot colors in most image formats is often complicated .
However , because of the way QuarkXPress supports PSD channels , it ’ s simpler and more flexible .
Bringing the PSD files into QuarkXPress is the same as any other image . Create a Box and then use File &gt; Import ... or simply drag and drop the image from your desktop , Finder or an application like Adobe Bridge ® with or without creating a box first .
To access the special features of PSD , open the PSD Import palette . ( Window &gt; PSD Import ) You ’ ll instantly see thumbnails of the layers along with their names .
For example , you ’ ve created a layer in Photoshop to give your image an antiqued look , but when you put it in your layout it seems swamped by the surrounding colors . One option might be to reduce the opacity of that layer by clicking on it and entering a new opacity level .
If you want to add an extra ink or plate to your images , you can set up a channel to do that in Photoshop . For example , maybe you intend to varnish part of an image , or you want to use a spot color within your image .
QuarkXPress can re ­ map any channel right in the PSD Import palette — non ­ destructively .
So click on the channels divider of the PSD Import Palette ; double click on the channel in question , and you can pick any color from your project ’ s color palette , ensuring consistency .
As powerful as the PSD support of QuarkXPress 8 is , it can ’ t manipulate certain kinds of layers , such as layer effects &#91; e.g.
If you use one of these layers , the image will import and print just fine , but you won ’ t get access to the layer controls of the PSD Import palette .
If you need that functionality , you can eliminate those kinds of layers from your PSD by converting the layer effects to stand ##AT##-##AT## alone layers or &apos; smart objects &apos; &#91; right click on the Layer in the Photoshop layers palette &#93; .
QuarkXPress supports text layers , most adjustment layers , and even 3D layers including opacity and blending mode controls .
Illustrator is a great tool for creating logos and vector illustrations .
Traditionally , the route into QuarkXPress has been to export an EPS from Illustrator .
Now , things are made much easier with the arrival of direct Illustrator .ai file import into QuarkXPress 8 .
Simply drag and drop or import your Illustrator native file into your layout just as you would any graphics file format .
QuarkXPress has a powerful transparency engine , but it doesn ’ t support partially transparent objects in PDF or .ai files yet .
So if you are using something like a drop shadow in Illustrator and plan to place that over a non ##AT##-##AT## white background or object , you might see undesirable results .
The good news is that the drop shadow and transparency features of QuarkXPress works on imported Illustrator files , so you can apply a drop shadow or change the opacity of your .ai file right in your layout instead .
QuarkXPress is well equipped for drawing tasks and in our newest release we have standardised many of our graphics tools to work more like Illustrator , Freehand and similar tools .

Barbecue and Mate Tea are Argentinian inventions with a social function .
Many Argentinian families have in their own grill in the backyard of their homes ( called parrillas ) , where they meet on the weekends for a meal together with friends and relatives .
The beef here has different cuts to that of Europe .

Like in Europe , meat is prepared rare , mid rare , done , well done etc .
The sauce which comes with the meat dish is called &quot; chimichurri &quot; . However , because of the excellent taste of the meat , it can well be eaten without sauce .
A full plate of mixed grill contains practically all animal innards from various animals .
The Sausage ( chorizo ) and the black pudding ( morcilla ) are very popular .
Served with the meats are vegetables ( sweet potatoes , pumpkin puree ) and mixed salads .
In a restaurant it is of course possible to order other parts of meats .
Depending on the season and region , it is possible to eat in Argentina very good food and meat such as deer , lamb , sheep , goat , fish , and other seafood .
Special delicacies are : king prawns ( centolla ) from Tierra de Fuego and wild boar ( jabalí ) or trout in Bariloche .
Special dishes , going back as far as colonial times are : &quot; pastel de choclo &quot; or the &quot; humita &quot; .
More typical are chicken &quot; pollo &quot; in its most varied prepartions , &quot; milanesa &quot; ( Viennese escalope ) , &quot; empanadas &quot; ( fried pastry shells filled with chopped beef , chicken , maize or cheese and ham ) or &quot; choripan &quot; similar to a Hot Dog .
Many Italian restaurants are found here which serve pizza and pasta .
Next to fresh fruit salads and good ice cream , a wide range of desserts are offered .
Two Argentine specialities are the &quot; dulce de leche &quot; , milk ##AT##-##AT## caramel marmalade which is also used to as a bread spread and the &quot; alfajores &quot; ( small cake ##AT##-##AT## formed biscuits with different fillings ) .

This section holds the most general questions about PHP : what it is and what it does .
Can I run several versions of PHP at the same time ?
What are the differences between PHP 3 and PHP 4 ?
What are the differences between PHP 4 and PHP 5 ?
I think I found a bug ! Who should I tell ?
Much of its syntax is borrowed from C , Java and Perl with a couple of unique PHP ##AT##-##AT## specific features thrown in .
The goal of the language is to allow web developers to write dynamically generated pages quickly .
This confuses many people because the first word of the acronym is the acronym .
This type of acronym is called a recursive acronym .
For more information , the curious can visit » Free On ##AT##-##AT## Line Dictionary of Computing or the » Wikipedia entry on recursive acronyms .
PHP / FI 2.0 is an early and no longer supported version of PHP .
PHP 3 is the successor to PHP / FI 2.0 and is a lot nicer .
PHP 5 is the current generation of PHP , which uses the » Zend engine 2 which , among other things , offers many additional OOP features .
Please see the » What &apos;s new in PHP 4 overview for a detailed explanation of these features and more .
While PHP 5 was purposely designed to be as compatible as possible with previous versions , there are some significant changes .
For more detailed information , please view the section on Migrating from PHP 4 to PHP 5 and the section on Backwards Incompatible Changes .
You should go to the PHP Bug Database and make sure the bug isn &apos;t a known bug .
If you don &apos;t see it in the database , use the reporting form to report the bug .
It is important to use the bug database instead of just sending an email to one of the mailing lists because the bug will have a tracking number assigned and it will then be possible for you to go back later and check on the status of the bug .

Note : Note that JPC and JP2 are capable of having components with different bit depths .
In this case , the value for &quot; bits &quot; is the highest bit depth encountered .
Also , JP2 files may contain multiple JPEG 2000 codestreams .
In this case , getimagesize ( ) returns the values for the first codestream it encounters in the root of the file .

It can reference a local file or ( configuration permitting ) a remote file using one of the supported streams .
This optional parameter allows you to extract some extended information from the image file .
Currently , this will return the different JPG APP markers as an associative array .
Some programs use these APP markers to embed text information in images .
A very common one is to embed » IPTC information in the APP13 marker .
You can use the iptcparse ( ) function to parse the binary APP13 marker into something readable .
Returns an array with 7 elements .
Index 0 and 1 contains respectively the width and the height of the image .
Note : Some formats may contain no image or may contain multiple images .
In these cases , getimagesize ( ) might not be able to properly determine the image size. getimagesize ( ) will return zero for width and height in these cases .
Index 2 is one of the IMAGETYPE ##UNDERSCORE## XXX constants indicating the type of the image .
Index 3 is a text string with the correct height = &quot; yyy &quot; width = &quot; xxx &quot; string that can be used directly in an IMG tag .
channels will be 3 for RGB pictures and 4 for CMYK pictures .

For the last few years the European Patent Office ( EPO ) has , contrary to the letter and spirit of the existing law , granted more than 30000 patents on rules of organisation and calculation claimed in terms of general ##AT##-##AT## purpose computing equipment , called &quot; programs for computers &quot; in the law of 1973 and &quot; computer ##AT##-##AT## implemented inventions &quot; in EPO Newspeak since 2000 .
Europe &apos;s patent movement is pressing to legitimate this practise by writing a new law .
Although the patent movement has lost major battles in November 2000 and September 2003 , Europe &apos;s programmers and citizens are still facing considerable risks .
Here you find the basic documentation , starting from the latest news and a short overview .
The patent movement has during several decades won the support of large corporations and governments for its expansionist cause .
Yet FFII , Eurolinux and others have devoted themselves to this work with considerable success .
Still , we continue to have more tasks than free hands .
Here we tell you how you can help us move forward more quickly .
A database of the monopolies on programming problems , which the European Patent Office has granted against the letter and spirit of the existing laws , and about which it is unsufficiently informing the public , delivering only chunks of graphical data hidden behind input masks .
The FFII software patent workgroup is trying to single out the software patents , make them better accessible and show their effects on software development .
During the last few years , the European Patent Office ( EPO ) has granted several 10000 patents on computer ##AT##-##AT## implemented rules of organisation and calculation , i.e. programs for computers &#91; as such &#93; .
We are systematically collecting these patents and republishing them in a more accessible form .

It ’ s the last month of the year … time to look back on this year and time to embrace the new one .
For the Kindo team it was a very exciting one and we are busy working in the arms of the MyHeritage family .
You can read the announcement here ( pdf ) , or get the complete FAQ here , but I wanted to give you some more background on why Kindo and MyHeritage have teamed up .
The first time we met Gilad , the founder and CEO of Myheritage , was in early 2007 – a few weeks before we released the first public version of Kindo .
Gareth and me were invited to have lunch with him in Soho in central London , and went there with the objective of learning everything we could about the “ enemy ” .
This proved to be pretty naive , since Gilad is much too nice to be called an “ enemy ” .
But there we were : A Swede , a South African and an Israeli , all with very different professional background and life stories , talking about the future of families online from very different perspectives .
I didn ’ t expect this , but we found that we had much in common .
We shared the same ideas and vision for what we wanted to achieve with our businesses , even though our approach was far from similar .
Kindo had set out to build a site that would help you interact with the family that is around you here and now .
We were trying to come up with tools to help you share information and communicate with the people that matter most to you right now .
MyHeritage on the other hand had developed amazing technologies to help you find out everything about your family ’ s history , and had spent years perfecting these technologies .
Ultimately though , what interested us both was the opportunity to help families discover more about who they are and their past , and use the web to bring them closer together .
As Gareth and I travelled back on the tube , we talked about how nice it would be to be able to offer our own users the same tools as MyHeritage already had .
What really got us excited was their SmartMatching Technology , which matches people in your family tree with 250 Million other names , and suggests who you might be related too .
During this summer , we ’ ve been thinking long and hard about the future of Kindo , and what the best option would be for taking Kindo to the next level .
The more time we spent with Gilad as well as the rest of the team in Israel ( not to mention the very loud rooster that runs around in their campus ) , the more convinced we all became - we ’ ll be better off together .
So we join the MyHeritage family because we share the same vision and values ( as families should ) , and because we think that we can build an amazing product together – bringing real benefits to families around the world .
This is what we ’ re planning to do over the next years .
As you see from the smiles in the picture below , this is a happy day for us here in the Putney Offices .
This years Swedish Genealogy Days the yearly conference of the Swedish Federation of Genealogical Societies was held in the city of Malmö in the province of Skåne in southern Sweden .
Over 100 exibitors crowded in the convention center at Europaporten in Malmö . Everything from genealogical societies , archives to companies offering original sources online .
In the meanwhile , you can still work on your profiles and upload the photos from the weekend ’ s family reunion .
Update : Now everything is fixed ! It was the database acting a bit weird but Stephen has done a great job to fix it .
Everyone hits a brick wall in genealogy , where the birth and death records just aren ’ t easy to find . In that case , try some different records .
Deeds often contain information on who sold what to whom ; who inherited what from whom ; or how some land was divided among a family . Historic tax records on land also sometimes have interesting information , such as co ##AT##-##AT## ownership .
Just as the squirrels and different kinds of birds collect nuts and seeds , someone in the Kindo office seems to be doing some really solid forward planning .
Judging from this picture - it ’ s going to be a looong winter .
As I point out in my book , Genealogy Online 8th Edition , you can do a lot of good research using search engines and Boolean operators ( AND , NOT , OR , and parentheses . ) Recently , Yahoo !
Advanced Google still accepts the most popular Boolean terms , and Exalead even supports the NEAR operator , which really helps with common surnames , but Live Search is now the only major search engine with full Boolean support .
For more details on how to do the Boolean Boogie for genealogy , read Genealogy Online 8th Edition .
Most beginners to genealogy are fuzzy about cousinship . For example , while many understand first cousins are people with common grandparents , many folks confuse first cousin once removed and second cousin .
Then , there are families like mine : My mother ’ s siblings were born from 1911 to 1932 . That means her youngest brother “ Mike ” went to school with the oldest sister ’ s oldest child , his niece “ Karen ” .
As it turned out , Uncle “ Mike ” and niece “ Karen ” married two people who were siblings , “ Michelle ” and “ Kevin ” , making their children both first cousins and first cousins once removed .
Showing degrees of relationship by blood .
“ Using DNA is one of the newest and latest tools of tracing your genealogy , and it ’ s remarkable , ” said Wells , who represented Family Tree DNA . ” You can see if they migrated , you can find out more about your great ##AT##-##AT## aunt and maybe she acted strangely , but that was because she had a baby die at childbirth … you just never know what secrets the past will reveal , ” Wells said .
-First it does not replace paper documentation since it does not name common ancestors , it is more a tool to prove lineage .
Several companies , like Family Tree DNA , can assist you to confirm your family tree or allow you to determine whether two people are related if you give them DNA of someone .
- It ’ s less reffective for females to use DNA than for males because thanks to Y ##AT##-##AT## DNA , we can determine paternal and maternal lines , whereas for females it is just maternal .
Here are a few suggestions to get you started : Introduction to Genealogy from National Genealogical Society ( U.S. ) Most genealogists take this course first . It is very American ##AT##-##AT## centric , but the techniques can be applied to any country ’ s vital statistics .

Lufthansa owes its origins to &quot; Deutsche Luft Hansa Aktiengesellschaft &quot; ( renamed &quot; Lufthansa &quot; in 1933 ) , which is formed from a merger between &quot; Deutsche Aero Lloyd &quot; ( DAL ) and &quot; Junkers Luftverkehr &quot; on January 6 .
The new airline inherits its crane logo , designed by &quot; Deutsche Luft ##AT##-##AT## Reederei &quot; in 1919 , from DAL , the blue ##AT##-##AT## and ##AT##-##AT## yellow house colours from Junkers .
It commences scheduled flights on April 6 with a fleet of 162 aircraft , of 18 different types .
A flying expedition to China is the event of the year .
Following its acquisition of shares in 1926 in the German ##AT##-##AT## Russian &quot; Dereluft &quot; airline , which was founded in 1921 , Lufthansa is influential in the founding of the Spanish Iberia , the Brazilian &quot; Syndicato Condor &quot; and the Chinese &quot; Eurasia &quot; airlines .
Lufthansa opens the first trans ##AT##-##AT## oceanic , scheduled airmail service across the South Atlantic .
Between 1936 and 1938 , it also experiments with scheduled air services across the North Atlantic .
After substantial expansion of the route network in 1939  including flights to Bangkok and Santiago de Chile  wartime air services , except for a few European countries , are suspended .
All flights are discontinued in 1945 and Lufthansa goes into receivership and is finally wound up and struck from the Berlin commercial register in 1965 .
The Federal Transport Minister sets up a working committee in 1951 to prepare for the resumption of air traffic in postwar Germany and entrusts the job of implementation to &quot; Büro Bongers &quot; , the office headed by Hans M. Bongers , the traffic chief of the old Lufthansa in Cologne . A new company to run air services and named &quot; Aktiengesellschaft für Luftverkehrsbedarf &quot; ( Luftag ) is founded in Cologne on January 6 , 1953 .
Lufthansa enters the jet age , initially on long ##AT##-##AT## haul routes , with the arrival in the fleet of the Boeing 707 .
The last of the propeller ##AT##-##AT## driven aircraft , a Vickers Viscount , is retired in 1971 .
Conversion to jet aircraft continues with the start of flights on medium ##AT##-##AT## haul routes with the Boeing 727 and , on short ##AT##-##AT## haul , with the Boeing 737 , the city jet largely fathered by Lufthansa .
The wide ##AT##-##AT## body era begins at Lufthansa with the delivery of its first Boeing 747 jumbo jet in 1970 , later to be joined by the McDonnell ##AT##-##AT## Douglas DC10 and the A300 , the first of the jets from the newly founded European aircraftmaker .
Lufthansa resumes flights to Berlin 45 years after the end of World War Two following Germany &apos;s reunification .
Lufthansa masters its worst ##AT##-##AT## ever economic crisis with a sweeping rehabilitation programme .
The airline , largely owned by the state , is privatised step by step .
Its MRO , cargo and IT businesses are spun off as independent companies .
Lufthansa , Air Canada , SAS , Thai Airways und United Airlines create the &quot; Star Alliance &quot; , the world &apos;s first multilateral airline grouping , later to be joined by other carriers .
The Lufthansa Aviation Group equips itself for the new millenium , training its focus on innovation and quality .
Placement of orders for 15 Airbus A380 megaliners charts the airline ’ s path into the future .
Even during times of crisis in the aviation industry , Lufthansa remains on the ascent : With the “ Future European Operations “ programme , the airline reorganises its regional markets , while gaining new partner airlines to expand the Star Alliance global route network .
Passengers enjoy greater comfort in a completely revamped Business Class with fast broadband Internet connectivity in the aircraft cabin .
Lufthansa creates new perspectives for Germany &apos;s future as a business location : Lufthansa orders 20 Boeing 747 ##AT##-##AT## 8s and is the launch customer for the aircraft .
Preparations for the A380 include route proving with Airbus , a new A380 maintenance hangar and a new terminal area in Frankfurt .
The Lufthansa Aviation Center becomes an architectural flagship .
Lufthansa Cargo founds the cargo airline AeroLogic with DHL Express .
Further partners strengthen the Star Alliance , which now encompasses 21 members .

There is finally an official answer to the question of whether or not WordPress themes must “ inherit ” the GPL license that WordPress itself uses .
Matt asked the Software Freedom Law Center to examine the WordPress source and how themes fit in . The final , official answer to whether themes must be GPL ?
The WordPress Plugin Competition is the best moment of the year , plugin wise .
This year ’ s edition is still running till the end of the month of July and as of writing , there are about 10 plugins ( with some really interesting stuff ) . Still , new plugins are released every day .
Why aren ’ t these authors joining the competition ? Participating in the competition is Instructive : you ##STAR## will ##STAR## learn something .
If WordPress were a country , our Bill of Rights would be the GPL because it protects our core freedoms .
We ’ ve always done our best to keep WordPress.org clean and only promote things that are completely compatible and legal with WordPress ’ license .
There have been some questions in the community about whether the GPL applies to themes like we ’ ve always assumed .
The Official WordPress Commercial Theme Directory is now open . It is linked off the WordPress Extend and is part of the parent theme directory set of links .
It is not as much a directory as it is a listing of sites that offer commercial GPL themes .
If you aren ’ t already following along , I highly recommend checking out the How To Create A WordPress Theme tutorial series by Ian Stewart ( ThemeShaper.com ) .
This 12 ##AT##-##AT## part series ( 8 complete at the time of this writing ) aims to take you from nothing to a fully functional , semantically rich , flexible WordPress theme in digestible chunks .
Along the way , Ian describes the changes being made , and why you are making them .
A critical vulnerability has been discovered in the WordPress Plugin Related Sites plugin .
An exploit is available in the wild and available on Milw0rm , making this attack easier to exploit .
Although , the vulnerability says that version 2.1 is vulnerable .
You should assume previous versions are vulnerable as well .

Beta 2 is here . Get it while it ’ s … still not quite out of Beta … or something .
Dev4Press has done some interesting work on benchmarking various aspects of WordPress and then testing out some popular questions on page loads etc .
The methodologies are well documented and the benchmarking setup is standardized .
They are testing three version of WordPress including 2.6.5 , 2.7.1 and 2.8 ( I wish they would have waited for 2.8.1 to be released ) .
Are you one of those worried about the progress of your WordPress blog ? Do you wanna know how your visitors found you and how they interact with your site ?
Well , it requires you to drill down the site analytics to get to the bottom .

It &apos;s not uncommon that a blog runs by different authors , so it may be useful if you can have a quick look at the drafts of all authors .
In our joint blog WP Engineer we created a feed , which keeps us up to date if a new draft of all authors were created . The work of every author is different and the dashboard is the center of information .
Therefore we have decided to supplement a widget in the Dashboard , which shows the last five drafts of all authors . I enhanced the existing Plugin Draft Feed .

Since so many people are having simple problems with their WordPress 2.8 installations , the WordPress community is working tirelessly to get a point ##AT##-##AT## one update out as soon as possible , and the first step on that road is to test a beta of the release .
WordPress 2.8.1 Beta 1 has been released , and they need people to test it out and see if it fixes the problems , so if you are having issues with WordPress 2.8 , try the beta , and see if that resolves it .
Some plugins are causing grief for those upgrading to 2.8 . HyperDB needs to be updated to the latest version , otherwise tags won ’ t save .
Plugins that load old versions of jQuery for all admin pages will break all kinds of stuff . Plugins should use the version of jQuery that ships with WP .

Lottery remains for centuries one of the most common forms of gambling endorsed by governments worldwide .
The very first signs of this popular trend take us way back to the Han Dynasty in the Far East where a Lottery was used to aid in the finance of major governmental projects , targeted mainly to glorify the government and its people .
The game of Lottery is very strongly printed in today � s culture and even celebrated with splendor as we approach the holiday season .
The biggest celebration by far takes us to our neighboring Spain , where locals participate and enjoy Spain � s national Christmas lottery game known as � El Gordo � ( The Fat One ) , since 1812 .
As well as being one of the oldest lotteries around , the total prize pool in recent years , have surpassed the 2 billion Euro mark , making it also the biggest lottery worldwide ! !
With prizes being so high , more than 100 new millionaires are produced every Christmas .
� � El Gordo � works differently to most lottery games played , as countless people can share one single ticket .
A whole lottery ticket ( � billete � ) costs a few thousand Euros but these tickets are split to smaller sections , each costing around 20 Euros .
This means that many , even strangers , may share a whole ticket .
The idea is quite befitting especially now , in holiday season where many people in one community share a grand prize worth millions .
Such an event can even affect the local economy .
The El Gordo takes place every 22nd of December and again on the 5th of January .
The whole drawing process takes at least three hours to complete , with the entire community tuned to the radio in suspense .
Participation is also available through the internet , so now you don � t necessarily have to be in Spain in order to enter this grand lottery event .

The Lord warns Nephi to depart into the wilderness .
His journeyings in the wilderness , and so forth .
Lehi prophesies of a land of liberty — His seed shall be scattered and smitten if they reject the Holy One of Israel — He exhorts his sons to put on the armor of righteousness .
1 And now it came to pass that after I , Nephi , had made an end of teaching my brethren , our a father , Lehi , also spake many things unto them , and rehearsed unto them , how great things the Lord had done for them in bringing them out of the land of Jerusalem .
2 And he spake unto them concerning their a rebellions upon the waters , and the mercies of God in sparing their lives , that they were not swallowed up in the sea .
3 And he also spake unto them concerning the land of promise , which they had obtained — how a merciful the Lord had been in b warning us that we should flee out of the land of Jerusalem .
4 For , behold , said he , I have a seen a b vision , in which I know that c Jerusalem is d destroyed ; and had we remained in Jerusalem we should also have e perished .
5 But , said he , notwithstanding our afflictions , we have obtained a a land of promise , a land which is b choice above all other lands ; a land which the Lord God hath c covenanted with me should be a land for the inheritance of my seed .
Yea , the Lord hath d covenanted this land unto me , and to my children forever , and also all those who should be e led out of other countries by the hand of the Lord .
6 Wherefore , I , Lehi , prophesy according to the workings of the Spirit which is in me , that there shall a none come into this land save they shall be brought by the hand of the Lord .
7 Wherefore , this a land is consecrated unto him whom he shall bring .
And if it so be that they shall serve him according to the commandments which he hath given , it shall be a land of b liberty unto them ; wherefore , they shall never be brought down into captivity ; if so , it shall be because of iniquity ; for if iniquity shall abound c cursed shall be the land for their sakes , but unto the righteous it shall be blessed forever .
8 And behold , it is wisdom that this land should be a kept as yet from the knowledge of other b nations ; for behold , many nations would overrun the land , that there would be no place for an inheritance .
9 Wherefore , I , Lehi , have obtained a a promise , that b inasmuch as those whom the Lord God shall bring out of the land of Jerusalem shall keep his commandments , they shall c prosper upon the face of this land ; and they shall be kept from all other nations , that they may possess this land unto themselves .
And if it so be that they shall d keep his commandments they shall be blessed upon the face of this land , and there shall be none to molest them , nor to take away the land of their e inheritance ; and they shall dwell safely forever .
11 Yea , he will bring a other nations unto them , and he will give unto them power , and he will take away from them the lands of their possessions , and he will cause them to be b scattered and smitten .
12 Yea , as one generation passeth to another there shall be a bloodsheds , and great visitations among them ; wherefore , my sons , I would that ye would remember ; yea , I would that ye would hearken unto my words .
13 O that ye would awake ; awake from a deep a sleep , yea , even from the sleep of b hell , and shake off the awful c chains by which ye are bound , which are the chains which bind the children of men , that they are carried away captive down to the eternal d gulf of misery and woe .
and arise from the dust , and hear the words of a trembling a parent , whose limbs ye must soon lay down in the cold and silent b grave , from whence no traveler can c return ; a few more d days and I go the e way of all the earth .
15 But behold , the Lord hath a redeemed my soul from hell ; I have beheld his b glory , and I am encircled about eternally in the c arms of his d love .
16 And I desire that ye should remember to observe the a statutes and the judgments of the Lord ; behold , this hath been the anxiety of my soul from the beginning .
18 Or , that a a cursing should come upon you for the space of b many generations ; and ye are visited by sword , and by famine , and are hated , and are led according to the will and captivity of the c devil .
19 O my sons , that these things might not come upon you , but that ye might be a choice and a a favored people of the Lord .
But behold , his will be done ; for his b ways are righteousness forever .
20 And he hath said that : a Inasmuch as ye shall keep my b commandments ye shall c prosper in the land ; but inasmuch as ye will not keep my commandments ye shall be cut off from my presence .
22 That ye may not be a cursed with a sore cursing ; and also , that ye may not incur the displeasure of a b just God upon you , unto the destruction , yea , the eternal destruction of both soul and body .
23 Awake , my sons ; put on the armor of a righteousness .
Shake off the b chains with which ye are bound , and come forth out of obscurity , and arise from the dust .
24 Rebel no more against your brother , whose views have been a glorious , and who hath kept the commandments from the time that we left Jerusalem ; and who hath been an instrument in the hands of God , in bringing us forth into the land of promise ; for were it not for him , we must have perished with b hunger in the wilderness ; nevertheless , ye sought to c take away his life ; yea , and he hath suffered much sorrow because of you .
25 And I exceedingly fear and tremble because of you , lest he shall suffer again ; for behold , ye have a accused him that he sought power and b authority over you ; but I know that he hath not sought for power nor authority over you , but he hath sought the glory of God , and your own eternal welfare .
26 And ye have murmured because he hath been plain unto you .
Ye say that he hath used a sharpness ; ye say that he hath been angry with you ; but behold , his b sharpness was the sharpness of the power of the word of God , which was in him ; and that which ye call anger was the truth , according to that which is in God , which he could not restrain , manifesting boldly concerning your iniquities .
27 And it must needs be that the a power of God must be with him , even unto his commanding you that ye must obey .
But behold , it was not he , but it was the b Spirit of the Lord which was in him , which c opened his mouth to utterance that he could not shut it .
28 And now my son , Laman , and also Lemuel and Sam , and also my sons who are the sons of Ishmael , behold , if ye will hearken unto the voice of Nephi ye shall not perish .
And if ye will hearken unto him I leave unto you a a blessing , yea , even my first blessing .
29 But if ye will not hearken unto him I take away my a first blessing , yea , even my blessing , and it shall rest upon him .
30 And now , Zoram , I speak unto you : Behold , thou art the a servant of Laban ; nevertheless , thou hast been brought out of the land of Jerusalem , and I know that thou art a true b friend unto my son , Nephi , forever .
31 Wherefore , because thou hast been faithful thy seed shall be blessed a with his seed , that they dwell in prosperity long upon the face of this land ; and nothing , save it shall be iniquity among them , shall harm or disturb their prosperity upon the face of this land forever .
32 Wherefore , if ye shall keep the commandments of the Lord , the Lord hath consecrated this land for the security of thy seed with the seed of my son .
Redemption cometh through the Holy Messiah — Freedom of choice ( agency ) is essential to existence and progression — Adam fell that men might be — Men are free to choose liberty and eternal life .
1 And now , Jacob , I speak unto you : Thou art my a first -born in the days of my tribulation in the wilderness .
And behold , in thy childhood thou hast suffered afflictions and much sorrow , because of the rudeness of thy brethren .
2 Nevertheless , Jacob , my first ##AT##-##AT## born in the wilderness , thou knowest the greatness of God ; and he shall consecrate thine a afflictions for thy gain .
3 Wherefore , thy soul shall be blessed , and thou shalt dwell safely with thy brother , Nephi ; and thy days shall be a spent in the service of thy God .
Wherefore , I know that thou art redeemed , because of the righteousness of thy Redeemer ; for thou hast b beheld that in the c fulness of time he cometh to bring salvation unto men .
4 And thou hast a beheld in thy youth his glory ; wherefore , thou art blessed even as they unto whom he shall minister in the flesh ; for the Spirit is the same , yesterday , today , and forever .
And the way is prepared from the fall of man , and b salvation is c free .
5 And men are instructed sufficiently that they a know good from evil .
And the b law is given unto men .
And by the law no flesh is c justified ; or , by the law men are d cut off .
Yea , by the temporal law they were cut off ; and also , by the spiritual law they perish from that which is good , and become miserable forever .
6 Wherefore , a redemption cometh in and through the b Holy c Messiah ; for he is full of d grace and truth .
7 Behold , he offereth himself a a sacrifice for sin , to answer the ends of the law , unto all those who have a broken heart and a contrite spirit ; and unto b none else can the c ends of the law be answered .
8 Wherefore , how great the importance to make these things known unto the inhabitants of the earth , that they may know that there is no flesh that can dwell in the presence of God , a save it be through the merits , and mercy , and grace of the Holy Messiah , who b layeth down his life according to the flesh , and taketh it again by the power of the Spirit , that he may bring to pass the c resurrection of the dead , being the first that should rise .
9 Wherefore , he is the firstfruits unto God , inasmuch as he shall make a intercession for all the children of men ; and they that believe in him shall be saved .
10 And because of the intercession for a all , all men come unto God ; wherefore , they stand in the presence of him , to be b judged of him according to the truth and c holiness which is in him .
11 For it must needs be , that there is an a opposition in all things .
If not so , my first ##AT##-##AT## born in the wilderness , righteousness could not be brought to pass , neither wickedness , neither holiness nor misery , neither good nor bad .
Wherefore , all things must needs be a compound in one ; wherefore , if it should be one body it must needs remain as dead , having no life neither death , nor corruption nor incorruption , happiness nor misery , neither sense nor insensibility .
12 Wherefore , it must needs have been created for a thing of naught ; wherefore there would have been no a purpose in the end of its creation .
Wherefore , this thing must needs destroy the wisdom of God and his eternal purposes , and also the power , and the mercy , and the b justice of God .
13 And if ye shall say there is a no law , ye shall also say there is no sin .
If ye shall say there is no sin , ye shall also say there is no righteousness .
And if there be no righteousness there be no happiness .
And if there be no righteousness nor happiness there be no punishment nor misery .
And if these things are not b there is no God .
And if there is no God we are not , neither the earth ; for there could have been no creation of things , neither to act nor to be acted upon ; wherefore , all things must have vanished away .
14 And now , my sons , I speak unto you these things for your profit and a learning ; for there is a God , and he hath b created all things , both the heavens and the earth , and all things that in them are , both things to act and things to be c acted upon .
15 And to bring about his eternal a purposes in the end of man , after he had b created our first parents , and the beasts of the field and the c fowls of the air , and in fine , all things which are created , it must needs be that there was an opposition ; even the d forbidden e fruit in f opposition to the g tree of life ; the one being sweet and the other bitter .
16 Wherefore , the Lord God gave unto man that he should a act for himself .
Wherefore , man could not b act for himself save it should be that he was c enticed by the one or the other .
17 And I , Lehi , according to the things which I have read , must needs suppose that an a angel of God , according to that which is written , had b fallen from heaven ; wherefore , he became a c devil , having sought that which was evil before God .
18 And because he had fallen from heaven , and had become miserable forever , he a sought also the misery of all mankind .
Wherefore , he said unto Eve , yea , even that old serpent , who is the devil , who is the father of all b lies , wherefore he said : Partake of the forbidden fruit , and ye shall not die , but ye shall be as God , c knowing good and evil .
19 And after Adam and Eve had a partaken of the forbidden fruit they were driven out of the garden of b Eden , to till the earth .
20 And they have brought forth children ; yea , even the a family of all the earth .
21 And the days of the children of a men were prolonged , according to the b will of God , that they might c repent while in the flesh ; wherefore , their state became a state of d probation , and their time was lengthened , according to the commandments which the Lord God gave unto the children of men .
For he gave commandment that all men must repent ; for he showed unto all men that they were e lost , because of the transgression of their parents .
22 And now , behold , if Adam had not transgressed he would not have fallen , but he would have remained in the garden of Eden .
And all things which were created must have remained in the same state in which they were after they were created ; and they must have remained forever , and had no end .
23 And they would have had no a children ; wherefore they would have remained in a state of innocence , having no b joy , for they knew no misery ; doing no good , for they knew no c sin .
24 But behold , all things have been done in the wisdom of him who a knoweth all things .
25 a Adam b fell that men might be ; and men c are , that they might have d joy .
26 And the a Messiah cometh in the fulness of time , that he may b redeem the children of men from the fall .
And because that they are c redeemed from the fall they have become d free forever , knowing good from evil ; to act for themselves and not to be acted upon , save it be by the punishment of the e law at the great and last day , according to the commandments which God hath given .
27 Wherefore , men are a free according to the b flesh ; and c all things are d given them which are expedient unto man .
And they are free to e choose f liberty and eternal g life , through the great Mediator of all men , or to choose captivity and death , according to the captivity and power of the devil ; for he seeketh that all men might be h miserable like unto himself .
29 And not choose eternal death , according to the will of the flesh and the a evil which is therein , which giveth the spirit of the devil power to b captivate , to bring you down to c hell , that he may reign over you in his own kingdom .
30 I have spoken these few words unto you all , my sons , in the last days of my probation ; and I have chosen the good part , according to the words of the prophet .
And I have none other object save it be the everlasting a welfare of your souls .
The Gods finish their planning of the creation of all things — They bring to pass the creation according to their plans — Adam names every living creature .
1 And thus we will finish the heavens and the earth , and all the a hosts of them .
2 And the Gods said among themselves : On the seventh time we will end our work , which we have counseled ; and we will a rest on the b seventh time from all our work which we have counseled .
3 And the Gods concluded upon the seventh time , because that on the seventh time they would a rest from all their b works which they ( the Gods ) counseled among themselves to form ; and c sanctified it .
And thus were their decisions at the time that they counseled among themselves to form the heavens and the earth .
5 According to all that which they had said concerning every plant of the field before it was in the a earth , and every herb of the field before it grew ; for the Gods had not caused it to rain upon the earth when they counseled to do them , and had not formed a man to till the ground .
6 But there went up a mist from the earth , and watered the whole face of the ground .
7 And the a Gods formed man from the b dust of the ground , and took his c spirit ( that is , the man ’ s spirit ) , and put it into him ; and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life , and man became a living d soul .
8 And the Gods planted a garden , eastward in a Eden , and there they put the man , whose spirit they had put into the body which they had formed .
9 And out of the ground made the Gods to grow every tree that is pleasant to the sight and good for food ; the a tree of life , also , in the midst of the garden , and the tree of knowledge of good and evil .
10 There was a river running out of Eden , to water the garden , and from thence it was parted and became into four heads .
11 And the Gods took the man and put him in the Garden of Eden , to dress it and to keep it .
13 But of the tree of knowledge of good and evil , thou shalt not eat of it ; for in the time that thou eatest thereof , thou shalt surely die .
Now I , Abraham , saw that it was after the Lord ’ s a time , which was after the time of b Kolob ; for as yet the Gods had not appointed unto Adam his reckoning .
14 And the Gods said : Let us make an help meet for the man , for it is not good that the man should be alone , therefore we will form an help meet for him .
16 And of the rib which the Gods had taken from man , formed they a a woman , and brought her unto the man .
18 Therefore shall a man leave his father and his mother , and shall a cleave unto his wife , and they shall be b one flesh .
19 And they were both naked , the man and his wife , and were not a ashamed .
20 And out of the ground the Gods formed every beast of the field , and every fowl of the air , and brought them unto Adam to see what he would call them ; and whatsoever a Adam called every living creature , that should be the name thereof .
21 And Adam gave a names to all b cattle , to the fowl of the air , to every beast of the field ; and for Adam , there was found an c help meet for him .
Men are called as high priests because of their exceeding faith and good works — They are to teach the commandments — Through righteousness they are sanctified and enter into the rest of the Lord — Melchizedek was one of these — Angels are declaring glad tidings throughout the land — They will reveal the actual coming of Christ .
1 And again , my brethren , I would cite your minds forward to the time when the Lord God gave these commandments unto his children ; and I would that ye should remember that the Lord God a ordained priests , after his holy order , which was after the order of his Son , to teach these things unto the people .
2 And those priests were ordained after the a order of his Son , in a b manner that thereby the people might know in what manner to look forward to his Son for redemption .
3 And this is the manner after which they were ordained — being a called and b prepared from the c foundation of the world according to the d foreknowledge of God , on account of their exceeding faith and good works ; in the first place being left to e choose good or evil ; therefore they having chosen good , and exercising exceedingly great f faith , are g called with a holy calling , yea , with that holy calling which was prepared with , and according to , a preparatory redemption for such .
4 And thus they have been a called to this holy calling on account of their faith , while others would reject the Spirit of God on account of the hardness of their hearts and b blindness of their minds , while , if it had not been for this they might have had as great c privilege as their brethren .
9 Thus they become a high priests forever , after the order of the Son , the Only Begotten of the Father , who is without beginning of days or end of years , who is full of b grace , equity , and truth .
11 Therefore they were called after this holy order , and were a sanctified , and their b garments were washed white through the blood of the Lamb .
12 Now they , after being a sanctified by the b Holy Ghost , having their garments made white , being c pure and spotless before God , could not look upon d sin save it were with e abhorrence ; and there were many , exceedingly great many , who were made pure and entered into the rest of the Lord their God .
13 And now , my brethren , I would that ye should humble yourselves before God , and bring forth a fruit meet for repentance , that ye may also enter into that rest .
14 Yea , humble yourselves even as the people in the days of a Melchizedek , who was also a high priest after this same order which I have spoken , who also took upon him the high priesthood forever .
15 And it was this same Melchizedek to whom Abraham paid a tithes ; yea , even our father Abraham paid tithes of one ##AT##-##AT## tenth part of all he possessed .
16 Now these a ordinances were given after this b manner , that thereby the people might look forward on the Son of God , it being a c type of his order , or it being his order , and this that they might look forward to him for a remission of their sins , that they might enter into the rest of the Lord .
18 But Melchizedek having exercised mighty faith , and received the office of the high priesthood according to the a holy order of God , did preach repentance unto his people .
And behold , they did repent ; and Melchizedek did establish peace in the land in his days ; therefore he was called the prince of peace , for he was the king of Salem ; and he did reign under his father .
19 Now , there were a many before him , and also there were many afterwards , but b none were greater ; therefore , of him they have more particularly made mention .
20 Now I need not rehearse the matter ; what I have said may suffice .
Behold , the a scriptures are before you ; if ye will b wrest them it shall be to your own destruction .
22 Yea , and the voice of the Lord , by the a mouth of angels , doth declare it unto all nations ; yea , doth declare it , that they may have glad tidings of great joy ; yea , and he doth sound these glad tidings among all his people , yea , even to them that are scattered abroad upon the face of the earth ; wherefore they have come unto us .
23 And they are made known unto us in a plain terms , that we may understand , that we cannot err ; and this because of our being b wanderers in a strange land ; therefore , we are thus highly favored , for we have these glad tidings declared unto us in all parts of our vineyard .
24 For behold , a angels are declaring it unto many at this time in our land ; and this is for the purpose of preparing the hearts of the children of men to receive his word at the time of his coming in his glory .
25 And now we only wait to hear the joyful news declared unto us by the mouth of angels , of his coming ; for the time cometh , we a know not how soon .
Would to God that it might be in my day ; but let it be sooner or later , in it I will rejoice .
26 And it shall be made known unto a just and holy men , by the mouth of angels , at the time of his coming , that the words of our fathers may be fulfilled , according to that which they have spoken concerning him , which was according to the spirit of prophecy which was in them .
29 a Having faith on the Lord ; having a hope that ye shall receive eternal life ; having the b love of God always in your hearts , that ye may be lifted up at the last day and enter into his c rest .
30 And may the Lord grant unto you repentance , that ye may not bring down his wrath upon you , that ye may not be a bound down by the chains of b hell , that ye may not suffer the second c death .
31 And Alma spake many more words unto the people , which are not written in a this book .
Revelation given through Joseph Smith , at Manchester , New York , March 1830 . HC 1 : 72 – 74 .
1 – 3 , Christ has all power ; 4 – 5 , All men must repent or suffer ; 6 – 12 , Eternal punishment is God ’ s punishment ; 13 – 20 , Christ suffered for all , that they might not suffer if they would repent ; 21 – 28 , Preach the gospel of repentance ; 29 – 41 , Declare glad tidings .
1 I am a Alpha and Omega , b Christ the Lord ; yea , even I am he , the beginning and the end , the Redeemer of the c world .
3 Retaining all a power , even to the b destroying of Satan and his works at the c end of the world , and the last great day of judgment , which I shall pass upon the inhabitants thereof , d judging every man according to his e works and the deeds which he hath done .
4 And surely every man must a repent or b suffer , for I , God , am c endless .
5 Wherefore , I a revoke not the judgments which I shall pass , but woes shall go forth , weeping , b wailing and gnashing of teeth , yea , to those who are found on my c left hand .
6 Nevertheless , it is a not written that there shall be no end to this torment , but it is written b endless c torment .
7 Again , it is written a eternal damnation ; wherefore it is more express than other scriptures , that it might work upon the hearts of the children of men , altogether for my name ’ s glory .
8 Wherefore , I will explain unto you this a mystery , for it is meet unto you to know even as mine apostles .
9 I speak unto you that are chosen in this thing , even as one , that you may enter into my a rest .
10 For , behold , the a mystery of godliness , how great is it !
For , behold , I am b endless , and the punishment which is given from my hand is endless c punishment , for d Endless is my name .
11 a Eternal punishment is God ’ s punishment .
15 Therefore I command you to repent — repent , lest I a smite you by the rod of my mouth , and by my wrath , and by my anger , and your b sufferings be sore — how sore you know not , how exquisite you know not , yea , how hard to bear you know not .
19 Nevertheless , glory be to the Father , and I partook and a finished my preparations unto the children of men .
20 Wherefore , I command you again to repent , lest I a humble you with my almighty power ; and that you b confess your sins , lest you suffer these c punishments of which I have spoken , of which in the smallest , yea , even in the least degree you have d tasted at the time I withdrew my Spirit .
21 And I command you that you a preach naught but repentance , and show b not these things unto the world until it is wisdom in me .
22 For they cannot a bear meat now , but b milk they must receive ; wherefore , they must not know these things , lest they perish .
23 a Learn of me , and listen to my words ; b walk in the c meekness of my Spirit , and you shall have d peace in me .
24 I am Jesus Christ ; I a came by the b will of the Father , and I do his will .
25 And again , I command thee that thou shalt not a covet thy b neighbor ’ s c wife ; nor seek thy neighbor ’ s life .
27 Which is my word to the a Gentile , that soon it may go to the b Jew , of whom the Lamanites are a c remnant , that they may believe the gospel , and look not for a d Messiah to come who has already come .
28 And again , I command thee that thou shalt a pray b vocally as well as in thy heart ; yea , before the world as well as in secret , in public as well as in private .
29 And thou shalt a declare glad tidings , yea , b publish it upon the mountains , and upon every high place , and among every people that thou shalt be permitted to see .
30 And thou shalt do it with all humility , a trusting in me , b reviling not against revilers .
31 And of a tenets thou shalt not talk , but thou shalt declare repentance and b faith on the Savior , and c remission of sins by d baptism , and by e fire , yea , even the f Holy Ghost .
32 Behold , this is a great and the last a commandment which I shall give unto you concerning this matter ; for this shall suffice for thy daily walk , even unto the end of thy life .
33 And misery thou shalt receive if thou wilt slight these a counsels , yea , even the destruction of thyself and property .
34 a Impart a portion of thy property , yea , even part of thy lands , and all save the support of thy b family .
35 Pay the a debt thou hast b contracted with the printer .
Release thyself from c bondage .
37 And a speak freely to all ; yea , preach , exhort , declare the b truth , even with a loud voice , with a sound of rejoicing , crying — Hosanna , hosanna , blessed be the name of the Lord God !
38 a Pray always , and I will b pour out my Spirit upon you , and great shall be your blessing — yea , even more than if you should obtain c treasures of earth and corruptibleness to the extent thereof .
39 Behold , canst thou read this without a rejoicing and lifting up thy heart for b gladness ?
40 Or canst thou run about longer as a a blind guide ?
41 Or canst thou be a humble and meek , and conduct thyself wisely before me ?
Revelation given to Joseph Smith the Prophet and Sidney Rigdon , at or near Fayette , New York , December 1830 . HC 1 : 128 – 131 .
At this time the Prophet was engaged almost daily in making a translation of the Bible .
The translation was begun as early as June 1830 , and both Oliver Cowdery and John Whitmer had served as scribes .
Since they had now been called to other duties , Sidney Rigdon was called by divine appointment to serve as the Prophet ’ s scribe in this work ( verse 20 ) .
As a preface to his record of this revelation the Prophet wrote : “ In December Sidney Rigdon came &#91; from Ohio &#93; to inquire of the Lord , and with him came Edward Partridge . .
1 – 2 , How men may become the sons of God ; 3 – 7 , Sidney Rigdon is called to baptize and confer the Holy Ghost ; 8 – 12 , Signs and miracles are wrought by faith ; 13 – 16 , The Lord ’ s servants shall thrash the nations by the power of the Spirit ; 17 – 19 , Joseph Smith holds the keys of the mysteries ; 20 – 21 , The elect shall abide the day of the Lord ’ s coming ; 22 – 27 , Israel shall be saved .
1 Listen to the voice of the a Lord your God , even b Alpha and Omega , the beginning and the end , whose c course is one d eternal round , the e same today as yesterday , and forever .
2 I am Jesus Christ , the Son of God , who was a crucified for the sins of the world , even as many as will b believe on my name , that they may become the c sons of God , even d one in e me as I am f one in the Father , as the Father is one in me , that we may be one .
3 Behold , verily , verily , I say unto my servant Sidney , I have looked upon thee and thy works .
I have a heard thy prayers , and prepared thee for a greater work .
4 Thou art blessed , for thou shalt do great things .
Behold thou wast sent forth , even as a John , to prepare the way before me , and before b Elijah which should come , and thou knewest it not .
6 But now I give unto thee a commandment , that thou shalt a baptize by water , and they shall receive the b Holy Ghost by the laying on of the c hands , even as the apostles of old .
7 And it shall come to pass that there shall be a great work in the land , even among the a Gentiles , for their b folly and their abominations shall be made manifest in the eyes of all people .
8 For I am God , and mine arm is not a shortened ; and I will show b miracles , c signs , and wonders , unto all those who d believe on my name .
9 And whoso shall ask it in my name in a faith , they shall b cast out c devils ; they shall heal the d sick ; they shall cause the blind to receive their e sight , and the deaf to hear , and the dumb to speak , and the lame to walk .
11 But a without faith shall not anything be shown forth except b desolations upon c Babylon , the same which has made d all nations drink of the wine of the wrath of her e fornication .
12 And there are a none that doeth good except those who are ready to b receive the fulness of my gospel , which I have sent forth unto this generation .
14 And their arm shall be my arm , and I will be their a shield and their buckler ; and I will gird up their loins , and they shall fight manfully for me ; and their b enemies shall be under their feet ; and I will let c fall the d sword in their behalf , and by the e fire of mine indignation will I preserve them .
16 And they shall learn the parable of the a fig -tree , for even now already summer is nigh .
18 And I have given unto him the a keys of the mystery of those things which have been b sealed , even things which were from the c foundation of the world , and the things which shall come from this time until the time of my coming , if he d abide in me , and if not , e another will I plant in his stead .
19 Wherefore , watch over him that his faith fail not , and it shall be given by the a Comforter , the b Holy Ghost , that knoweth all things .
21 For they will hear my a voice , and shall b see me , and shall not be c asleep , and shall d abide the day of my e coming ; for they shall be f purified , even as I am pure .
22 And now I say unto you , a tarry with him , and he shall journey with you ; forsake him not , and surely these things shall be fulfilled .
23 And a inasmuch as ye do not write , behold , it shall be b given unto him to prophesy ; and thou shalt preach my gospel and call on c the holy prophets to prove his words , as they shall be given him .
25 And a Israel shall be b saved in mine own due time ; and by the c keys which I have given shall they be led , and no more be confounded at all .
26 a Lift up your hearts and be glad , your b redemption draweth nigh .
27 Fear not , little a flock , the b kingdom is yours until I come .
Revelation given through Joseph Smith the Prophet , on the bank of the Missouri River , McIlwaine ’ s Bend , August 12 , 1831 . HC 1 : 202 – 205 .
On their return trip to Kirtland the Prophet and ten elders had traveled down the Missouri River in canoes .
On the third day of the journey many dangers were experienced .
Elder William W. Phelps , in daylight vision , saw the destroyer riding in power upon the face of the waters .
1 – 12 , The Lord has decreed many destructions upon the waters ; 13 – 22 , The waters were cursed by John , and the destroyer rideth upon their face ; 23 – 29 , Some have power to command the waters ; 30 – 35 , Elders are to journey two by two and preach the gospel ; 36 – 39 , They are to prepare for the coming of the Son of Man .
1 Behold , and hearken unto the voice of him who has all a power , who is from everlasting to everlasting , even b Alpha and Omega , the beginning and the end .
3 But verily I say unto you , that it is not needful for this whole company of mine elders to be moving swiftly upon the waters , whilst the inhabitants on either side are perishing in unbelief .
5 For I , the Lord , have decreed in mine anger many destructions upon the waters ; yea , and especially upon these waters .
6 Nevertheless , all flesh is in mine hand , and he that is faithful among you shall not a perish by the waters .
7 Wherefore , it is expedient that my servant Sidney Gilbert and my servant a William W. Phelps be in haste upon their errand and mission .
9 But now , verily I say , it behooveth me that ye should part .
10 And inasmuch as they are a faithful they shall be preserved , and I , the Lord , will be b with them .
11 And let the residue take that which is needful for clothing .
12 Let my servant Sidney Gilbert take that which is not needful with him , as you shall agree .
13 And now , behold , for your a good I gave unto you a b commandment concerning these things ; and I , the Lord , will reason with you as with men in days of old .
14 Behold , I , the Lord , in the beginning blessed the a waters ; but in the last days , by the mouth of my servant John , I b cursed the waters .
15 Wherefore , the days will come that no flesh shall be safe upon the waters .
16 And it shall be said in days to come that none is able to go up to the land of Zion upon the waters , but he that is upright in heart .
17 And , as I , the Lord , in the beginning a cursed the land , even so in the last days have I b blessed it , in its time , for the use of my saints , that they may partake the fatness thereof .
19 I , the Lord , have decreed , and the destroyer rideth upon the face thereof , and I revoke not the decree .
20 I , the Lord , was a angry with you yesterday , but today mine anger is turned away .
21 Wherefore , let those concerning whom I have spoken , that should take their journey in haste — again I say unto you , let them take their journey in haste .
22 And it mattereth not unto me , after a little , if it so be that they fill their mission , whether they go by water or by land ; let this be as it is made known unto them a according to their judgments hereafter .
23 And now , concerning my servants , Sidney Rigdon , Joseph Smith , Jun . , and Oliver Cowdery , let them come not again upon the waters , save it be upon the canal , while journeying unto their homes ; or in other words they shall not come upon the waters to journey , save upon the canal .
25 And they shall do a like unto the children of Israel , b pitching their tents by the way .
26 And , behold , this commandment you shall give unto all your brethren .
28 Wherefore , let him do as the Spirit of the living God commandeth him , whether upon the land or upon the waters , as it remaineth with me to do hereafter .
29 And unto you is given the course for the saints , or the way for the saints of the camp of the Lord , to journey .
31 And in that place they shall lift up their voices unto God against that people , yea , unto him whose anger is a kindled against their wickedness , a people who are well ##AT##-##AT## nigh b ripened for destruction .
32 And from thence let them journey for the congregations of their brethren , for their labors even now are wanted more abundantly among them than among the congregations of the wicked .
34 And inasmuch as they do this they shall a rid their garments , and they shall be spotless before me .
35 And let them journey together , or a two by two , as seemeth them good , only let my servant Reynolds Cahoon , and my servant Samuel H. Smith , with whom I am well pleased , be not separated until they return to their homes , and this for a wise purpose in me .
37 And inasmuch as you have humbled yourselves before me , the blessings of the a kingdom are yours .
38 Gird up your loins and be a watchful and be sober , looking forth for the coming of the Son of Man , for he cometh in an hour you think not .
39 Pray always that you enter not into a temptation , that you may abide the day of his coming , whether in life or in death .
Revelation given through Joseph Smith the Prophet , at Hiram , Ohio , November 1831 , at the request of Orson Hyde , Luke S. Johnson , Lyman E. Johnson , and William E. McLellin . HC 1 : 227 – 229 .
Although this revelation was given in response to supplication that the mind of the Lord be made known concerning the elders named , much of the content pertains to the whole Church .
1 My servant , Orson Hyde , was called by his ordination to proclaim the a everlasting gospel , by the b Spirit of the living God , from people to people , and from land to land , in the c congregations of the wicked , in their d synagogues , reasoning with and e expounding all scriptures unto them .
3 And this is the a ensample unto them , that they shall b speak as they are moved upon by the Holy Ghost .
4 And whatsoever they shall speak when moved upon by the a Holy Ghost shall be scripture , shall be the will of the Lord , shall be the mind of the Lord , shall be the word of the Lord , shall be the voice of the Lord , and the b power of God unto salvation .
5 Behold , this is the promise of the Lord unto you , O ye my servants .
6 Wherefore , be of good a cheer , and do not b fear , for I the Lord am with you , and will stand by you ; and ye shall bear record of me , even Jesus Christ , that I am the Son of the living God , that I c was , that I am , and that I am to come .
8 a Go ye into all the world , b preach the gospel to every c creature , acting in the d authority which I have given you , e baptizing in the name of the Father , and of the Son , and of the Holy Ghost .
9 And a he that believeth and is baptized shall be saved , and he that believeth not shall be b damned .
10 And he that believeth shall be blest with a signs following , even as it is written .
12 And of as many as the Father shall bear record , to you shall be given power to a seal them up unto eternal life .
15 Wherefore they shall be a high priests who are worthy , and they shall be appointed by the b First Presidency of the Melchizedek Priesthood , except they be literal descendants of c Aaron .
17 For the firstborn holds the right of the presidency over this priesthood , and the a keys or authority of the same .
18 No man has a legal right to this office , to hold the keys of this priesthood , except he be a a literal descendant and the firstborn of Aaron .
19 But , as a a high priest of the Melchizedek Priesthood has authority to officiate in all the lesser offices he may officiate in the office of b bishop when no literal descendant of Aaron can be found , provided he is called and set apart and ordained unto this power , under the hands of the First Presidency of the Melchizedek Priesthood .
20 And a literal descendant of Aaron , also , must be designated by this Presidency , and found worthy , and a anointed , and ordained under the hands of this Presidency , otherwise they are not legally authorized to officiate in their priesthood .
21 But , by virtue of the decree concerning their right of the priesthood descending from father to son , they may claim their a anointing if at any time they can prove their lineage , or do ascertain it by revelation from the Lord under the b hands of the above named Presidency .
24 And if he repent he shall be a forgiven , according to the covenants and b commandments of the church .
25 And again , inasmuch as a parents have children in Zion , or in any of her b stakes which are organized , that c teach them not to understand the d doctrine of repentance , faith in Christ the Son of the living God , and of baptism and the gift of the Holy Ghost by the laying on of the hands , when e eight years old , the f sin be upon the heads of the parents .
26 For this shall be a law unto the a inhabitants of Zion , or in any of her stakes which are organized .
27 And their children shall be a baptized for the b remission of their sins when c eight years old , and receive the laying on of the hands .
28 And they shall also a teach their children to pray , and to walk uprightly before the Lord .
29 And the inhabitants of Zion shall also observe the a Sabbath day to keep it holy .
30 And the inhabitants of Zion also shall remember their a labors , inasmuch as they are appointed to labor , in all faithfulness ; for the b idler shall be had in remembrance before the Lord .
31 Now , I , the Lord , am not well a pleased with the inhabitants of Zion , for there are b idlers among them ; and their c children are also growing up in d wickedness ; they also e seek not earnestly the riches of eternity , but their eyes are full of f greediness .
32 These things ought not to be , and must be done away from among them ; wherefore , let my servant Oliver Cowdery a carry these sayings unto the land of Zion .
33 And a commandment I give unto them — that he that observeth not his a prayers before the Lord in the season thereof , let him be had in b remembrance before the judge of my people .
34 These sayings are a true and faithful ; wherefore , transgress them not , neither b take therefrom .
35 Behold , I am a Alpha and Omega , and I b come quickly .

Revelation given through Joseph Smith the Prophet to Oliver Cowdery , at Harmony , Pennsylvania , April 1829 .
HC 1 : 37 – 38 . Oliver is admonished to be patient , and is urged to be content to write , for the time being , at the dictation of the translator , rather than to attempt to translate .
1 – 6 , Other ancient records are yet to be translated ; 7 – 14 , The Book of Mormon is translated by study and by spiritual confirmation .
1 Behold , I say unto you , my son , that because you did not a translate according to that which you desired of me , and did commence again to b write for my servant , Joseph Smith , Jun . , even so I would that ye should continue until you have finished this record , which I have entrusted unto him .
2 And then , behold , a other b records have I , that I will give unto you power that you may assist to c translate .
3 Be patient , my son , for it is a wisdom in me , and it is not expedient that you should translate at this present time .
4 Behold , the work which you are called to do is to a write for my servant Joseph .
5 And , behold , it is because that you did not continue as you commenced , when you began to translate , that I have taken away this privilege from you .
6 Do not a murmur , my son , for it is wisdom in me that I have dealt with you after this manner .
7 Behold , you have not understood ; you have supposed that I would give it unto you , when you took no thought save it was to ask me .
8 But , behold , I say unto you , that you must a study it out in your b mind ; then you must c ask me if it be right , and if it is right I will cause that your d bosom shall e burn within you ; therefore , you shall f feel that it is right .
9 But if it be not right you shall have no such feelings , but you shall have a a stupor of thought that shall cause you to forget the thing which is wrong ; therefore , you cannot write that which is b sacred save it be given you from me .
10 Now , if you had known this you could have a translated ; nevertheless , it is not expedient that you should translate now .
12 For , do you not behold that I have a given unto my servant b Joseph sufficient strength , whereby it is made up ?
And neither of you have I condemned .
13 Do this thing which I have commanded you , and you shall a prosper .
Be faithful , and yield to no b temptation .
14 Stand fast in the a work wherewith I have b called you , and a hair of your head shall not be lost , and you shall be c lifted up at the last day .
The words of his preaching unto his brethren .
He confoundeth a man who seeketh to overthrow the doctrine of Christ .
A few words concerning the history of the people of Nephi .
Jacob and Joseph seek to persuade men to believe in Christ and keep his commandments — Nephi dies — Wickedness prevails among the Nephites .
1 For behold , it came to pass that ##STAR## fifty and five years had passed away from the time that Lehi left Jerusalem ; wherefore , Nephi gave me , Jacob , a a commandment concerning the b small plates , upon which these things are engraven .
2 And he gave me , Jacob , a commandment that I should a write upon b these plates a few of the things which I considered to be most precious ; that I should not touch , save it were lightly , concerning the history of this people which are called the people of Nephi .
3 For he said that the history of his people should be engraven upon his a other plates , and that I should b preserve these plates and hand them down unto my seed , from generation to generation .
4 And if there were preaching which was a sacred , or revelation which was great , or prophesying , that I should engraven the b heads of them upon these plates , and touch upon them as much as it were possible , for Christ ’ s sake , and for the sake of our people .
5 For because of faith and great anxiety , it truly had been made manifest unto us concerning our people , what things should a happen unto them .
6 And we also had many revelations , and the spirit of much prophecy ; wherefore , we knew of a Christ and his kingdom , which should come .
7 Wherefore we labored diligently among our people , that we might persuade them to a come unto Christ , and partake of the goodness of God , that they might enter into his b rest , lest by any means he should swear in his wrath they should not c enter in , as in the d provocation in the days of temptation while the children of Israel were in the e wilderness .
8 Wherefore , we would to God that we could persuade all men a not to rebel against God , to b provoke him to anger , but that all men would believe in Christ , and view his death , and suffer his c cross and bear the shame of the world ; wherefore , I , Jacob , take it upon me to fulfil the commandment of my brother Nephi .
9 Now Nephi began to be old , and he saw that he must soon a die ; wherefore , he b anointed a man to be a king and a ruler over his people now , according to the reigns of the c kings .
11 Wherefore , the people were desirous to retain in remembrance his name .
And whoso should reign in his stead were called by the people , second Nephi , third Nephi , and so forth , according to the reigns of the kings ; and thus they were called by the people , let them be of whatever name they would .
12 And it came to pass that Nephi died .
13 Now the people which were not a Lamanites were Nephites ; nevertheless , they were called Nephites , Jacobites , Josephites , b Zoramites , Lamanites , Lemuelites , and Ishmaelites .
14 But I , Jacob , shall not hereafter distinguish a them by these names , but I shall b call them Lamanites that seek to destroy the people of Nephi , and those who are friendly to Nephi I shall call c Nephites , or the d people of Nephi , according to the reigns of the kings .
15 And now it came to pass that the people of Nephi , under the reign of the second king , began to grow hard in their hearts , and indulge themselves somewhat in wicked practices , such as like unto David of old desiring many a wives and b concubines , and also Solomon , his son .
16 Yea , and they also began to search much a gold and silver , and began to be lifted up somewhat in pride .
17 Wherefore I , Jacob , gave unto them these words as I taught them in the a temple , having first obtained mine b errand from the Lord .
18 For I , Jacob , and my brother Joseph had been a consecrated priests and b teachers of this people , by the hand of Nephi .
19 And we did a magnify our office unto the Lord , taking upon us the b responsibility , answering the sins of the people upon our own heads if we did not c teach them the word of God with all diligence ; wherefore , by laboring with our might their d blood might not come upon our garments ; otherwise their blood would come upon our garments , and we would not be found spotless at the last day .

Chessboxers go through alternating four ##AT##-##AT## minute long rounds of chess and three ##AT##-##AT## minute boxing rounds with a one ##AT##-##AT## minute break in between .
A maximum total of 11 rounds are fought out — six rounds of chess and five rounds of boxing . The fight begins with a round of chess .
Each player has a respite of 12 minutes during the game of chess , which means the maximum duration of the whole chess game is 24 minutes .
A K.O. or checkmate can lead to an early win , and the fight can also be cut short if a player exceeds the chess time limit or the referee decides the fight has to be aborted .
If the game of chess ends with a tie , it is settled with the points earned in the boxing rounds .
If the boxing fight ends with a tie , the player who had black on the chessboard wins .
- Chess and boxing … how does that go together ?
Chessboxing is the ultimate challenge for both the body and the mind .
More and more contemporary athletic disciplines are characterised by multifaceted challenges .
It ’ s comparable to a biathlon , as one example .
Extreme physical stress is combined with a huge mental challenge .
Chessboxing is a bit more radical than a biathlon , but through targeted training , the body can be prepared for matches just as well as it can for a biathlon .
The alteration between boxing and playing chess represents the biggest challenge .
- When was the first ##AT##-##AT## ever chessboxing fight and when was the WCBO founded ?
The first official chessboxing fight ever to be held was the Middleweight World Championship between Iepe the Joker and Luis the Lawyer on the 14th of November 2003 at the Paradiso in Amsterdam .
Iepe the Joker won the match after a dramatic fight in the 11th and last round when Luis the Lawyer exceeded his time limit in chess .
Shortly before this championship , the WCBO was founded .
- What is the goal of the WCBO ?
Our primary objective is the official dissemination of chessboxing as a self ##AT##-##AT## contained , internationally recognised athletic discipline .
The cornerstone for out goal has been laid with the founding of the first Chess Boxing Club of Berlin . In addition , we also support initiatives for starting chessboxing clubs nationwide and abroad .
- What does the WCBO ’ s slogan mean — “ Fighting is done in the ring and wars are waged on the board ” ?
With this slogan , we ’ re trying to promote aggression management .
Fighting is simply done in the ring where certain fairness rules apply and where there ’ s a referee .
Wars should be waged on the board , not in reality .
- How did the idea of chessboxing come about ?
The idea originates from the comic Le froid eqateur ( literally ‘ cold equator ’ ) by Enki Bilal .
Chessboxing was initially conceived by the Dutch artist IEPE as an artistic performance in which the themes of a healthy spirit in a healthy body and aggression management played a role .
After just a short period of time , an opportunity arose to further develop the chessboxing concept into a serious sport in collaboration with experts from Berlin and the Dutch chess and boxing federation .
- What would the ultimate chessboxing fight be like ?
In an ESPN interview , Lennox Lewis already expressed some interest and prior to the legendary Heavyweight World Championship in Los Angeles in 2005 , Vitali Klitschko offered to play a game of chess with Lennox Lewis before they entered the ring .
- How many fights does the WCBO hold each year ?
The WCBO aims at holding three to four championship fights each year .

If you were told that en is a Spanish preposition and were asked what it means , you most likely would guess &quot; in &quot; or &quot; on .
&quot; And you &apos;d be right — in both cases . But en can also be translated as &quot; at , &quot; &quot; about , &quot; &quot; by , &quot; &quot; on top of , &quot; &quot; upon , &quot; &quot; inside of &quot; and other ways , so its use isn &apos;t as straightforward as it may appear .
Fortunately , when en doesn &apos;t mean &quot; on &quot; or &quot; in , &quot; you can usually tell by the context what is meant .
Like some other prepositions , en can seem quite versatile to the foreigner .
Indicating location and meaning &quot; in &quot; : El dinero está en la caja . The money is in the box .
I live in Spain . ( Note : &quot; In &quot; meaning &quot; inside of &quot; also can be expressed by dentro de .
Indicating location and meaning &quot; on &quot; : El dinero está en la mesa . The money is on the table .
He put the posters on the wall . ( Note : The preposition a alternatively could have been used in the second sentence .
To express a value : Vendió el carro en $ 2.000 . He sold the car for $ 2,000 .
( Note : The preposition por alternatively could have been used in the previous sentence . Vendió el carro por $ 2.000 .
With certain verbs to mean &quot; in &quot; or &quot; on &quot; : Competer en , to compete in ; concentrarse en , to concentrate on ; concurrir en , to concur in ; confiar en , to trust in ; creer en , to believe in ; empeñarse en , to persist in ; esperar en , to trust in ; insistir en , to insist on ; intervenir en , to participate in ; persistir en , to persist in ; reflejar en , to reflect on ; resultar en , to result in .
As a beginner , you don &apos;t need to memorize all the phrases and verbs that use en ; of the verb phrases , pensar en ( to think about ) is the most common one that causes beginners difficulty .
But you should be aware of those uses , so you know that en might not mean &quot; in &quot; or &quot; on .

By including the most important updates for Windows 2000 , Update Rollup 1 for Windows 2000 SP4 may help customers make Windows 2000 ##AT##-##AT## based computers more secure .
Update Rollup 1 for Windows 2000 SP4 also makes it easier for customers to build new deployment images .
This update rollup requires less predeployment testing , because the number of updates that are included in this update rollup is smaller than the number of updates that are typically included in a service pack .
Most customers installed current versions of many of the files when older updates were installed .
Additionally , Microsoft has already released most of the contents of this update rollup as individual updates and hotfixes .
Individual hotfixes that are not included in this update rollup will be available as individual downloads .
Because Microsoft believes that Update Rollup 1 for Windows SP4 meets the needs of customers better than a new service pack for Windows 2000 , Microsoft will not release another service pack for Windows 2000 .
Therefore , Windows 2000 SP4 is the final service pack for Windows 2000 .
Customers who have not yet installed Windows 2000 SP4 should consider installing Windows 2000 SP4 as soon as possible .
Windows 2000 with SP4 is a prerequisite for Update Rollup 1 for Windows 2000 SP4 .
Q1 : Why does Microsoft believe that Update Rollup 1 for Windows 2000 SP4 meets the needs of customers better than a new service pack for Windows 2000 ?
A1 : Microsoft talked to many customers about their plans for maintaining their Windows 2000 deployments .
The most frequent requests were for Microsoft to make keeping Windows 2000 ##AT##-##AT## based computers up to date as easy as possible , and for Microsoft to reduce the predeployment testing that customers have to perform .
Update rollups may help customers make their computers more secure .
Update rollups also help customers build new system images without applying and tracking individual hotfixes .
Update Rollup 1 for Windows 2000 SP4 requires less predeployment testing because the number of updates that are included in the update rollup is smaller than the number of updates that are typically included in a service pack .
Because Windows 2000 is a mature product , many of the Windows 2000 hotfixes that were released after the release of Windows 2000 SP4 address relatively obscure problems .
These problems affect a small number of customers .
At this point , an update rollup provides the most usefulness at the least risk of instability .
Q2 : How will Microsoft list Update Rollup 1 for Windows SP4 on the Windows Update Web site ?
A2 : Update Rollup 1 for Windows SP4 is listed as a high ##AT##-##AT## priority update in the &quot; Critical and Service Packs &quot; category on the Windows Update Web site .
During the next few months , Windows Update will transition Windows 2000 customers to a new version of Windows Update .
After this transition , Update Rollup 1 for Windows 2000 SP4 will be listed in the &quot; High Priority Updates &quot; category .
Q3 : Should I install Update Rollup 1 for Windows SP4 even if I have kept my Windows 2000 SP4 systems up to date ?
Update Rollup 1 for Windows 2000 SP4 contains important fixes that have not previously been part of individual security updates .
Additionally , this update rollup contains enhancements that may help increase system security , increase reliability , reduce support costs , and support the current generation of PC hardware .
To address minor compatibility problems that were introduced by earlier security updates , hotfixes may have updated some files that were installed by the earlier updates .
This update includes the latest versions of these files .
Therefore , even if a system is fully up to date , Windows Update still detects and installs this update rollup .
Customers who use managed security update deployment solutions should decide whether to deploy Update Rollup 1 within their infrastructure .
Q4 : Will Update Rollup 1 for Windows 2000 SP4 be distributed over Automatic Updates ?
A4 : At first , this update rollup will not be distributed over Automatic Updates .
This delay is because of the transition from the Windows Update version 4 infrastructure to the version 6 infrastructure .
This update rollup will be made available as an automatic update in September , 2005 .
Q5 : Will there be an administrative blocking tool for Update Rollup 1 for Windows 2000 SP4 like there was for Windows XP SP2 ?
A5 : No , Update Rollup 1 for Windows 2000 SP4 is not a service pack .
Therefore , this update rollup does not require the same level of deployment control .
This update rollup is treated like other security or reliability updates .
These updates are typically distributed by Windows Update and by Automatic Updates .
Q6 : Do I have to install the individual security bulletin updates before I install Update Rollup 1 for Windows 2000 on new installations of Windows 2000 ?
First install Windows 2000 SP4 , and then install the update rollup .
After you install the update rollup , run Windows Update to find updates that were released after April 30 , 2005 , or that were not included in the update rollup .
Q7 : Are customers required to install Update Rollup 1 for Windows 2000 SP4 ?
A7 : Customers are not required to install Update Rollup 1 for Windows 2000 SP4 .
Microsoft designed the update rollup to make it easy to keep Windows 2000 ##AT##-##AT## based computers up to date .
Therefore , we strongly recommend that customers install Update Rollup 1 for Windows 2000 SP4 as soon as they can .
Q8 : After Update Rollup 1 for Windows SP4 is installed on a computer that is running Windows 2000 SP4 , will the service pack level of Windows 2000 change ?
The service pack level of the computer remains at Windows 2000 SP4 .
After you install Update Rollup 1 for Windows SP4 , the computer will be up to date from a life ##AT##-##AT## cycle policy perspective until the end ##AT##-##AT## of ##AT##-##AT## life date for Windows 2000 .
The end ##AT##-##AT## of ##AT##-##AT## life date for Windows 2000 will be no sooner than January 1 , 2010 .
Q9 : Is this the first time that Microsoft has produced an update rollup instead of a service pack ?
Microsoft has produced update rollups before .
Q10 : If Update Rollup 1 for Windows 2000 SP4 offers significant benefits over a new service pack , why does Microsoft not always use update rollups instead of service packs ?
A10 : Service packs and update rollups play different , yet complimentary roles .
Service packs deliver important updates and new features that customers request before the next release of a major operating system .
Update rollups deliver a group of updates between more major releases .
Microsoft uses update rollups when there is a longer than typical gap between service pack releases .
Later in the life cycle of a product , update rollups make it easier for customers to keep their computers up to date .
When customers install an update rollup , customers do not have to individually install all the updates that are available for a product .
Q11 : How does Microsoft decide which hotfixes to include in an update rollup ?
A11 : Microsoft examines the number of times that customers request and download each hotfix from Microsoft Web sites and from Product Support .
Microsoft also evaluates the potential cost savings for customers .
This evaluation is based on experience in the Windows 2000 data center environment at Microsoft .
Q12 : What kinds of updates are included in Update Rollup 1 for Windows 2000 SP4 ?
A12 : Update Rollup 1 for Windows 2000 SP4 contains all the security updates that were produced for Windows 2000 after the release of SP4 until April 30 , 2005 .
Update Rollup 1 for Windows 2000 SP4 also contains a small number of important non ##AT##-##AT## security updates .
For example , Update Rollup 1 for Windows 2000 SP4 contains updates to address problems that are time ##AT##-##AT## consuming for support professionals to troubleshoot and fix .
Q13 : What specific updates and hotfixes are included in Update Rollup 1 for Windows 2000 SP4 ?
A13 : The following table lists all the updates and hotfixes that are included in Update Rollup 1 for Windows 2000 SP4 .
Update Rollup 1 for Windows 2000 SP4 changes how telephony server and client computers communicate using the Telephony Application Programming Interface ( TAPI ) .
After you install Update Rollup 1 for Windows 2000 SP4 , a Windows 2000 telephony client accepts only encrypted RPC packets from a telephony server .
The client does not communicate with a telephony server that sends non ##AT##-##AT## encrypted RPC packets .
However , this restriction does not apply to TAPI deployments where the client computers are using mailslot instead of remote procedure call ( RPC ) for communications with the telephony server .
This restriction also does not apply where the telephony server uses mailslot for communications .
By default , a Windows 2000 client uses mailslot to communicate with the telephony server .
A Windows 2000 client uses RPC only when the client is explicitly configured as connection ##AT##-##AT## oriented .
To configure the client this way , use the tcmsetup command together with the -x switch .
Update Rollup 1 for Windows 2000 SP4 does not contain updates for Windows components that are not included with a clean slipstream install of Windows 2000 SP4 .
If components were previously installed or updated , you must download individual security updates by using Windows Update .
The Microsoft VM is not included in SP4 natively .
However the VM may be resident on systems which were updated to SP4 from a prior SP or installed by a third party software package .
Windows 2000 originally included Internet Explorer 5.01 .
Service packs for Windows 2000 only affect this version .
We recommend that you install Internet Explorer 6 SP1 and the current cumulative Internet Explorer security updates on Windows 2000 computers .
After you apply Microsoft Windows 2000 Update Rollup 1 , you may receive an error message when you try to print .

Information as a concept has a diversity of meanings , from everyday usage to technical settings .
Generally speaking , the concept of information is closely related to notions of constraint , communication , control , data , form , instruction , knowledge , meaning , mental stimulus , pattern , perception , and representation .
According to the Oxford English Dictionary , the first known historical meaning of the word information in English was the act of informing , or giving form or shape to the mind , as in education , instruction , or training . A quote from 1387 English text : &quot; Five books come down from heaven for information of mankind .
a particular instruction . &quot; Melibee had heard the great skills and reasons of Dame Prudence , and her wise information and techniques .
The English word was apparently derived from the Latin accusative form ( informationem ) of the nominative ( informatio ) : this noun is on its turn derived from the verb &quot; informare &quot; ( to inform ) in the sense of &quot; to give form to the mind &quot; , &quot; to discipline &quot; , &quot; instruct &quot; , &quot; teach &quot; : &quot; Men so wise should go and inform their kings .
&quot; ( 1330 ) Inform itself comes ( via French ) from the Latin verb informare , to give form to , to form an idea of .
Furthermore , Latin itself already even contained the word informatio meaning concept or idea , but the extent to which this may have influenced the development of the word information in English is unclear .
As a final note , the ancient Greek word for form was &quot; μορφή &quot; ( morf - &gt; morphe , Morph ) and also είδος eidos ( kind , idea , shape , set ) , the latter word was famously used in a technical philosophical sense by Plato ( and later Aristotle ) to denote the ideal identity or essence of something ( see Theory of forms ) .
&quot; Eidos &quot; can also be associated with thought , proposition or even concept .
Information is a term with many meanings depending on context , but is as a rule closely related to such concepts as meaning , knowledge , instruction , communication , representation , and mental stimulus . Simply stated , information is a message received and understood .
There are many other aspects of information since it is the knowledge acquired through study or experience or instruction . But overall , information is the result of processing , manipulating and organizing data in a way that adds to the knowledge of the person receiving it .
Information is the state of a system of interest . Message is the information materialized .
Information is always about something ( size of a parameter , occurrence of an event , value , ethics , etc ) . Viewed in this manner , information does not have to be accurate ; it may be a truth or a lie , or just the sound of a falling tree .
Even a disruptive noise used to inhibit the flow of communication and create misunderstanding would in this view be a form of information . However , generally speaking , if the amount of information in the received message increases , the message is more accurate .
An important variation identifies information as that which would be communicated by a message if it were sent from a sender to a receiver capable of understanding the message . In another variation , it is not required that the sender be capable of understanding the message , or even cognizant that there is a message , making information something that can be extracted from an environment , e.g. , through observation , reading or measurement .
Communication theory provides a numerical measure of the uncertainty of an outcome . For example , we can say that &quot; the signal contained thousands of bits of information &quot; .
This is used in application of statistics to estimation theory and to science in general . Fisher information is thought of as the amount of information that a message carries about an unobservable parameter .
For example , with a normal likelihood function , the Fisher information is the reciprocal of the variance of the law . In the absence of knowledge of the likelihood law , the Fisher information may be computed from normally distributed score data as the reciprocal of their second moment .
The view of information as a message came into prominence with the publication in 1948 of an influential paper by Claude Shannon , &quot; A Mathematical Theory of Communication .
&quot; This thesis provides the foundations of information theory and endows the word information not only with a technical meaning but also a measure .
If the sending device is equally likely to send any one of a set of N messages , then the preferred measure of &quot; the information produced when one message is chosen from the set &quot; is the base two logarithm of N ( This measure is called self ##AT##-##AT## information ) .
It is important to recognize the limitations of traditional information theory and algorithmic information theory from the perspective of human meaning .
For example , when referring to the meaning content of a message Shannon noted “ Frequently the messages have meaning … these semantic aspects of communication are irrelevant to the engineering problem .
The significant aspect is that the actual message is one selected from a set of possible messages ” ( emphasis in original ) .
In information theory signals are part of a process , not a substance ; they do something , they do not contain any specific meaning . Combining algorithmic information theory and information theory we can conclude that the most random signal contains the most information as it can be interpreted in any way and cannot be compressed .
Michael Reddy noted that &quot; &apos; signals &apos; of the mathematical theory are &apos; patterns that can be exchanged &apos; .
There is no message contained in the signal , the signals convey the ability to select from a set of possible messages .
&quot; In information theory &quot; the system must be designed to operate for each possible selection , not just the one which will actually be chosen since this is unknown at the time of design &quot; .
Information can be defined as a pattern , a combination of qualities that form a characteristic arrangement . This view assumes neither accuracy nor directly communicating parties , but instead assumes a separation between an object and its representation .
What are commonly referred to as data in computing , statistics , and other fields , are forms of information in this sense . The electro ##AT##-##AT## magnetic patterns in a computer network and connected devices are related to something other than the pattern itself , such as text characters to be displayed and keyboard input .
On the other hand , according to semiotics , data is symbols with certain syntax and information is data with a certain semantic . Painting and drawing contain information to the extent that they represent something such as an assortment of objects on a table , a profile , or a landscape .
But if information can be defined merely as a pattern , does that mean that neither utility nor meaning are necessary components of information ?
Arguably a distinction must be made between raw unprocessed data and information which possesses utility , value or some quantum of meaning .
On this view , information may indeed be characterized as a pattern ; but this is a necessary condition , not a sufficient one .
When one interprets representation , one can predict a broader pattern from a limited number of observations ( inference ) or understand the relation between patterns of two different things ( decoding ) . One example of the former is to sip a soup to know if it is spoiled ; an example of the latter is examining footprints to determine the animal and its condition .
In his book Sensory Ecology , Dusenbery called these causal inputs . Other inputs ( information ) are important only because they are associated with causal inputs and can be used to predict the occurrence of a causal input at a later time ( and perhaps another place ) .
Some information is important because of association with other information but eventually there must be a connection to a causal input .
In practice , information is usually carried by weak stimuli that must be detected by specialized sensory systems and amplified by energy inputs before they can be functional to the organism or device .
For example , light is often a causal input to plants but provides information to animals . The colored light reflected from a flower is too weak to do much photosynthetic work but the visual system of the bee detects it and the bee &apos;s nervous system uses the information to guide the bee to the flower , where the bee often finds nectar or pollen , which are causal inputs , serving a nutritional function .
Information is any type of pattern that influences the formation or transformation of other patterns . In this sense , there is no need for a conscious mind to perceive , much less appreciate , the pattern .
Consider , for example , DNA . The sequence of nucleotides is a pattern that influences the formation and development of an organism without any need for a conscious mind .
Systems theory at times seems to refer to information in this sense , assuming information does not necessarily involve any conscious mind , and patterns circulating ( due to feedback ) in the system can be called information .
In other words , it can be said that information in this sense is something potentially perceived as representation , though not created or presented for that purpose .
If , however , the premise of &quot; influence &quot; implies that information has been perceived by a conscious mind and also interpreted by it , the specific context associated with this interpretation may cause the transformation of the information into knowledge .
Stewart ( 2001 ) argues that the transformation of information into knowledge is a critical one , lying at the core of value creation and competitive advantage for the modern enterprise .
In 2003 , J. D. Bekenstein claimed there is a growing trend in physics to define the physical world as being made of information itself ( and thus information is defined in this way ) ( see Digital physics ) .
Information has a well defined meaning in physics . Examples of this include the phenomenon of quantum entanglement where particles can interact without reference to their separation or the speed of light .
Information itself cannot travel faster than light even if the information is transmitted indirectly . This could lead to the fact that all attempts at physically observing a particle with an &quot; entangled &quot; relationship to another are slowed down , even though the particles are not connected in any other way other than by the information they carry .
Another link is demonstrated by the Maxwell &apos;s demon thought experiment .
In this experiment , a direct relationship between information and another physical property , entropy , is demonstrated .
A consequence is that it is impossible to destroy information without increasing the entropy of a system ; in practical terms this often means generating heat .
Another , more philosophical , outcome is that information could be thought of as interchangeable with energy .
Thus , in the study of logic gates , the theoretical lower bound of thermal energy released by an AND gate is higher than for the NOT gate ( because information is destroyed in an AND gate and simply converted in a NOT gate ) .
Physical information is of particular importance in the theory of quantum computers .
Records are a specialized form of information .
Essentially , records are information produced consciously or as by ##AT##-##AT## products of business activities or transactions and retained because of their value .
Primarily their value is as evidence of the activities of the organization but they may also be retained for their informational value .
Sound records management ensures that the integrity of records is preserved for as long as they are required .
Records may be maintained to retain corporate memory of the organization or to meet legal , fiscal or accountability requirements imposed on the organization .
Willis ( 2005 ) expressed the view that sound management of business records and information delivered &quot; … six key requirements for good corporate governance … transparency ; accountability ; due process ; compliance ; meeting statutory and common law requirements ; and security of personal and corporate information .
Beynon ##AT##-##AT## Davies &#91; 2 &#93; explains the multi ##AT##-##AT## faceted concept of information in terms of that of signs and sign ##AT##-##AT## systems . Signs themselves can be considered in terms of four inter ##AT##-##AT## dependent levels , layers or branches of semiotics : pragmatics , semantics , syntax , and empirics .
Pragmatics is concerned with the purpose of communication . Pragmatics links the issue of signs with that of intention .
The focus of pragmatics is on the intentions of human agents underlying communicative behaviour . In other words , intentions link language to action .

Los Angeles was founded September 4 , 1781 , by Spanish governor Felipe de Neve as El Pueblo de Nuestra Señora la Reina de los Angeles del Río de Porciúncula ( The Village of Our Lady , the Queen of the Angels of the river of Porziuncola ) .
&#91; 5 &#93; It became a part of Mexico in 1821 , following its independence from Spain . In 1848 , at the end of the Mexican ##AT##-##AT## American War , Los Angeles and California were purchased as part of the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo , thereby becoming part of the United States ; Mexico retained the territory of Baja California .
Los Angeles was incorporated as a municipality on April 4 , 1850 , five months before California achieved statehood .
Los Angeles is one of the world &apos;s centers of business , international trade , entertainment , culture , media , fashion , science , technology , and education .
It is home to renowned institutions covering a broad range of professional and cultural fields , and is one of the most substantial economic engines within the United States .
As the home base of Hollywood , it is known as the &quot; Entertainment Capital of the World &quot; , leading the world in the creation of motion pictures , television production and recorded music . The importance of the entertainment business to the city has led many celebrities to call Los Angeles and its surrounding suburbs home .
The Los Angeles coastal area was first settled by the Tongva ( or Gabrieleños ) and Chumash Native American tribes thousands of years ago . The first Europeans arrived in 1542 in an expedition organized by the viceroy of New Spain and commanded by Juan Rodríguez Cabrillo , a Portuguese ##AT##-##AT## born explorer who claimed the area of southern California for the Spanish Empire .
In 1771 , Franciscan friar Junípero Serra built the Mission San Gabriel Arcangel near Whittier Narrows , in what is now called San Gabriel Valley . &#91; 8 &#93; In 1777 , the new governor of California , Felipe de Neve , recommended to Antonio María de Bucareli y Ursúa , viceroy of New Spain , that the site noted by Juan Crespí be developed into a pueblo .
Tradition has it that on this day they were escorted by four Spanish colonial soldiers , two priests from the Mission and Governor de Neve . The town was named El Pueblo de Nuestra Señora la Reina de los Ángeles del Río de Porciúncula ( The Town of Our Lady the Queen of the Angels on the Porciúncula River ) .
Railroads arrived when the Southern Pacific completed its line to Los Angeles in 1876 .
&#91; 13 &#93; Oil was discovered in 1892 , and by 1923 Los Angeles was producing one ##AT##-##AT## quarter of the world &apos;s petroleum .
By 1900 , the population had grown to more than 102,000 people , &#91; 15 &#93; putting pressure on the city &apos;s water supply .
&#91; 16 &#93; 1913 &apos;s completion of the Los Angeles Aqueduct , under the supervision of William Mulholland , assured the continued growth of the city .
In the 1920s , the motion picture and aviation industries flocked to Los Angeles .
In 1932 , with population surpassing one million , &#91; 17 &#93; the city hosted the Summer Olympics .
Also in the 1980s , Los Angeles became the center of the heavy metal music scene , especially glam metal bands . &#91; 20 &#93; In 1984 , the city hosted the Summer Olympic Games for the second time .
Despite being boycotted by 14 Communist countries , the 1984 Olympics became the most financially successful in history , and only the second Olympics to turn a profit – the other being the 1932 Summer Olympics , also held in Los Angeles .
During the remaining decades of the 20th century , the city was plagued by increasing gang warfare , drug trades , and police corruption .
Racial tensions erupted again in 1992 with the Rodney King controversy and the large ##AT##-##AT## scale riots that followed the acquittal of his police attackers .
Voters defeated efforts by the San Fernando Valley and Hollywood to secede from the city in 2002 .
Gentrification and urban redevelopment have occurred in many parts of the city , most notably Hollywood , Koreatown , Silver Lake , Echo Park and Downtown .
Los Angeles is irregularly shaped and covers a total area of 498.3 square miles ( 1,291 km2 ) , comprising 469.1 square miles ( 1,214.9 km2 ) of land and 29.2 square miles ( 75.7 km2 ) of water .
The city extends for 44 miles ( 71 km ) longitudinally and for 29 miles ( 47 km ) latitudinally . The perimeter of the city is 342 miles ( 550 km ) .
The highest point in Los Angeles is Mount Lukens , also called Sister Elsie Peak .
&#91; 24 &#93; Located at the far reaches of the northeastern San Fernando Valley , it reaches a height of 5,080 ft ( 1,548 m ) . The major river is the Los Angeles River , which begins in the Canoga Park district of the city and is largely seasonal .
The period of May through October is warm to hot and dry with average high temperatures of 74 - 84 ° F ( 24 - 29 ° C ) and lows of 58 - 66 ° F ( 14 - 19 ° C ) , however temperatures frequently exceed 90 ° F ( 32 ° C ) and occasionally reach 100 ° F ( 38 ° C ) in inland areas ( away from the moderating effect of the ocean ) .
The period of November through April is mild and somewhat rainy with average high temperatures of 68 - 73 ° F ( 20 - 23 ° C ) and lows of 48 - 53 ° F ( 9 - 12 ° C ) , but temperatures could occasionally drop to low 40s ( ~ 5 ° C ) or be as high as 80 ° F ( 26 ° C ) for few days during winter .
The Los Angeles area is also subject to the phenomenon typical of a microclimate .
As such , the temperatures can vary as much as 18 ° F ( 10 ° C ) between inland areas and the coast , with a temperature gradient of over one degree per mile ( 1.6 km ) from the coast inland .
California has also a weather phenomenon called &quot; June Gloom or May Grey &quot; , which sometimes gives overcast or foggy skies in the morning at the coast , but usually gives sunny skies by noon , during late spring and early summer .
Los Angeles averages 15 inches ( 385 mm ) of precipitation annually , which mainly occurs during the winter and spring ( November thru April ) with generally light rain showers , but sometimes as heavy rainfall and thunderstorms .
The coast gets slightly less rainfall , while the mountains get slightly more .
Years of average rainfall are rare ; the usual pattern is bimodal , with a short string of dry years ( perhaps 7 ##AT##-##AT## 8 inches / 175 ##AT##-##AT## 200 mm ) followed by one or two wet years that make up the average .
Snowfall is extremely rare in the city basin , but the mountains within city limits slopes typically receive snowfall every winter .
The greatest snowfall recorded in downtown Los Angeles was 2 inches ( 5 cm ) in 1932 .
The name given by the Chumash tribe of Native Americans for the area now known as Los Angeles translates to &quot; the valley of smoke &quot; . &#91; 35 &#93; because of the smog from native campfires .
Owing to geography , heavy reliance on automobiles , and the Los Angeles / Long Beach port complex , Los Angeles suffers from air pollution in the form of smog . The Los Angeles Basin and the San Fernando Valley are susceptible to atmospheric inversion , which holds in the exhausts from road vehicles , airplanes , locomotives , shipping , manufacturing , and other sources .
&#91; 36 &#93; Unlike other large cities that rely on rain to clear smog , Los Angeles gets only 15 inches ( 381 mm ) of rain each year : pollution accumulates over many consecutive days . Issues of air quality in Los Angeles and other major cities led to the passage of early national environmental legislation , including the Clean Air Act .
More recently , the state of California has led the nation in working to limit pollution by mandating low emission vehicles .
As a result , pollution levels have dropped in recent decades . The number of Stage 1 smog alerts has declined from over 100 per year in the 1970s to almost zero in the new millennium .
Despite improvement , the 2006 and 2007 annual reports of the American Lung Association ranked the city as the most polluted in the country with short ##AT##-##AT## term particle pollution and year ##AT##-##AT## round particle pollution .
&#91; 38 &#93; &#91; 39 &#93; In 2008 , the city was ranked the second most polluted and again had the highest year ##AT##-##AT## round particulate pollution . &#91; 40 &#93; In addition , the groundwater is increasingly threatened by MTBE from gas stations and perchlorate from rocket fuel .
The city is divided into many neighborhoods , many of which were incorporated places or communities that were annexed by the city . There are also several independent cities around Los Angeles , but they are popularly grouped with the city of Los Angeles , either due to being completely engulfed as enclaves by Los Angeles , or lying within its immediate vicinity .

The city is the largest in the U.S. without an NFL team .
There was a time when Los Angeles boasted two NFL teams , the Rams and the Raiders .
Both left the city in 1995 , with the Rams moving to St. Louis and the Raiders heading back to Oakland .
Los Angeles is the second ##AT##-##AT## largest city and television market in the United States , but has no NFL team ( see List of television stations in North America by media market ) .
Since the franchise &apos;s departures the NFL as an organization , and individual NFL owners , have attempted to relocate a team to the city . Immediately following the 1995 NFL season , Seattle Seahawks owner Ken Behring went as far as packing up moving vans to start play in the Rose Bowl under a new team name and logo for the 1996 season .
&#91; 69 &#93; In 2003 , then NFL Commissioner Paul Tagliabue indicated L.A. would get a new expansion team , a thirty ##AT##-##AT## third franchise , after the choice of Houston over L.A. in the 2002 league expansion round . &#91; 70 &#93; When the New Orleans Saints were displaced from the Superdome by Hurricane Katrina media outlets reported the NFL was planning to move the team to Los Angeles permanently .

The city is governed by a mayor ##AT##-##AT## council system . The current mayor is Antonio Villaraigosa .
There are 15 city council districts . Other elected city officials include the City Attorney Carmen Trutanich and the City Controller Wendy Greuel .
The city attorney prosecutes misdemeanors within the city limits . The district attorney , elected by county voters , prosecutes misdemeanors in unincorporated areas and in 78 of the 88 cities in the county , as well as felonies throughout the county .
Voters created Neighborhood Councils in the Charter Reform of 1999 . First proposed by City Council member Joel Wachs in 1996 , they were designed to promote public participation in government and make it more responsive to local needs .
The councils cover districts which are not necessarily identical to the traditional neighborhoods of Los Angeles .
Almost ninety neighborhood councils ( NCs ) are certified and all &quot; stakeholders &quot; — meaning anyone who lives , works or owns property in a neighborhood — may vote for members of the councils &apos; governing bodies .
Some council bylaws allow other people with a stake in the community to cast ballots as well .
The councils are official government bodies and so their governing bodies and committees must abide by California &apos;s Brown Act , which governs the meetings of deliberative assemblies .
The first notable concern of the neighborhood councils collectively was the opposition by some of them in March 2004 to an 18 % increase in water rates by the city &apos;s Department of Water and Power .
This led the City Council to approve only a limited increase pending independent review .
More recently , some of the councils petitioned the City Council in summer 2006 to allow them to introduce ideas for legislative action , but the City Council put off a decision .
The neighborhood councils have been allocated $ 50,000 each for administration , outreach and approved neighborhood projects .
In May 2009 , the city council floated a measure to reduce the funding of the neighborhood councils to $ 11,200 each .

Los Angeles Unified School District serves almost all of the city of Los Angeles , as well as several surrounding communities , with a student population over 800,000 . &#91; 79 &#93; After Proposition 13 was approved in 1978 , urban school districts had considerable trouble with funding .
LAUSD has become known for its underfunded , overcrowded and poorly maintained campuses , although its 162 Magnet schools help compete with local private schools .
&#91; 80 &#93; Several small sections of Los Angeles are in the Las Virgenes Unified School District .
Los Angeles County Office of Education operates the Los Angeles County High School for the Arts . The Los Angeles Public Library system operates 72 public libraries in the city .
The Los Angeles County Metropolitan Transportation Authority and other agencies operate an extensive system of bus lines , as well as subway and light rail lines across Los Angeles County , with a combined daily ridership of 1.7 million . &#91; 82 &#93; The majority of this ( 1.4 million ) is taken up by the city &apos;s bus system , the second busiest in the country .
The subway and light rail combined average the remaining roughly 319,000 boardings per weekday . &#91; 83 &#93; Altogether , public transit ridership is much lower than many other large cities , with 12 % of Los Angeles commuters riding public transportation .
The city &apos;s subway system is the ninth busiest in the United States and its light rail system is the country &apos;s third busiest .
The rail system includes the Red and Purple subway lines , as well as the Gold , Blue , and Green light rail lines .
The Metro Rapid buses are a bus rapid transit program with stops and frequency similar those of a light rail .
The city is also central to the commuter rail system Metrolink which links Los Angeles to all neighboring counties as well as many suburbs .

It adjoins the separate Port of Long Beach .
The sea ports of the Port of Los Angeles and Port of Long Beach together make up the Los Angeles – Long Beach Harbor . There are also smaller , non ##AT##-##AT## industrial harbors along L.A. &apos; s coastline .
The port includes four bridges : the Vincent Thomas Bridge , Henry Ford Bridge , Gerald Desmond Bridge , and Commodore Schuyler F. Heim Bridge .

It is open ; you can go in and out any time you want , right ? Right .
Until someone steps in , claims the door as his and tells you you have to pay to get in .
Oh , and he ( and everyone else ) still considers the door open , because you can see what &apos;s on the other side . See , open door , open formats !
Yeah . So , you probably know some open formats already : MP3 , OOXML , Xvid , H.264 and the rest of the MPEG ##AT##-##AT## 4 mess .
Because their specification is , in fact , open , which means you can implement it anywhere you want ... if you pay to cross the door .
Well , I guess you can &apos;t implement it afer all .
If freedom is catchy , as some people claim , then free formats would have taken over by now , wouldn &apos;t they ?
I too wish it was that simple .
Until recently , there wasn &apos;t an exact distinction between open and free formats , but such distinction is becoming more and more clear .
It &apos;s got to the point where the big corps are attacking free formats to protect their investments in the open ones .
As soon as word got out that Theora would be the baseline video codec of HTML 5 , a Nokia representative came out of nowhere and vaguely suggested that a submarine patent may be there somewhere .
Neither he or Nokia have expanded on this , nor will they .
The damage was already done , and Nokia &apos;s investments in 3GPP technology were not wasted .
They hadn &apos;t paid all that money in licenses , hardware optimizations and research to make MPEG ##AT##-##AT## 4 work on cellphones just to let an upstart that everyone else could implement win the race . No way , ese !
And you likely already know about the whole OOXML debacle . How Microsoft got so afraid of OpenDocument ( ODF ) that they invested millions and millions on a 6000 page pile of — let &apos;s face it — crap .
Pure , pointless crap . To beat another office format .
And they bribed every ISO jurisdiction they could .
To beat another office format . Because it would mean everyone would use a single format and make Microsoft &apos;s office suite obsolete .
This isn &apos;t anymore about closed vs. open formats , and you don &apos;t need me to rub it in your face .
It &apos;s time to leave those non ##AT##-##AT## free formats behind and look forward for a world of interoperability , a world of doors free to trespass in whatever way you want , and where no one will be able to take that freedom away from anyone else .
tl ; dr version : Just because something calls itself an open standard , it doesn &apos;t mean it should be trusted .

Spandau is the westernmost district ( Bezirk ) of the German capital city of Berlin , the town itself situated at the confluence of the Spree and Havel rivers .
Once a town in its own right , Spandau is one of the oldest areas in the Berlin region and still retains much of its own unique character , having been spared the worst of the Allied bombing in the Second World War that so devastated the rest of the city . The center of the town is formed by a dense network of medieval streets and a market square , still retaining a large number of timber ##AT##-##AT## framed buildings .
Maybe the sweetest little bed and breakfast place in Berlin . Outside the center in Spandau , close to lakes and rivers , to the Olympic Stadium and the convention center .

Bornholm &#91; 1 &#93; is Denmark &apos; s crown jewel . &apos; The Pearl of the Baltic &apos; has sandy beaches on the south of the island which are renowned for their Mediterranean light and feel .
Its forests impart a more rugged feel than found elsewhere in densly ##AT##-##AT## populated Denmark .
Though practically unknown to Americans , this island of light is a favorite vacation spot for Scandinavians , Germans , and Poles . Its position in the middle of the Baltic ( it is closer to Sweden , Poland and Germany than to rest of Denmark ) gives both a secluded , yet international feel .
As of January 2003 Bornholms five regions assembled into one administrative and political unit called Bornholms Regionskommune . As of January 2007 Bornholm belongs to the Capital Region .
A battle between Denmark and Sweden in 1645 led to Swedish control of the island , but it was brief - they left again the same year . In the Roskildepeace of 1658 Bornholm , Skaane , Halland and Blekinge were given to Sweden .
In 1658 the Swedish commander of Bornholm was killed in Rønne , and the people of Bornholm freed themselves from years of foreign command . Bornholm was given to the Danish king as ‘ his island ’ .
Jens Kofoed , Poul Anker , Peder Olsen and Villum Clausen became champions of liberty . The same four men have , in modern times , given name to the ferries from Bornholmstrafikken .
Bornholm was Danish until World War Two , and then was it taken over by the Germans and later freed by the Russians in 1945 ; the Russian wouldn ’ t leave Bornholm because of the progressing cold war and only left after being given some special privileges .
As Bornholm has many tourists each year most people speak either English , German or Swedish , the exception being most of the older population .
Almost all tourist folders are to be found in English , German , Polish and a Scandinavian language .
There is an airport in Rønne and numerous regular flights on a daily basis to Copenhagen are operated by Cimber Air and Danish Air Transport .
Also , Bornholm Airport is an international gateway fulfilling all requirements linked to this fact . Naturally direct booking and luggage check ##AT##-##AT## in to foreign destinations via Copenhagen Airport is available at the ticket office in our air terminal .
You can get to the island by ferry or airplane , but the island also provides excellent opportunities for arriving by private boat .
It ’ s easy getting around either by car , bus or bicycles .
The charge for a trip from the airport to Rønne is approximately € 7 , and a trip from Rønne to Nexø ( longest distance ) is € 50 .
There are 9 bus lines connecting cities and attractions . Some stops are designed for getting off , walking a scenic route and getting on a bus at the next stop .
The BAT 24 hour ticket at € 18 can be a good deal if you travel a few times and do not want to worry about the rates and zones .

Bornholm is famous for its many high quality crafts such as blown glass and textiles . Visit the different shops and exhibits .

Okavango Delta - A unique geological formation where a delta is formed by a river ( the Okavango ) flowing into the Kalahari desert instead of the ocean .
There are several entry points by road to Botswana : In the south at Gaborone , providing access from Johannesburg ; in the west providing access from Namibia ; the north providing access from Namibia , Zambia and Zimbabwe ; and at Francistown in the east , providing access from Harare .
All road access is good and the primary roads within Botswana are paved and well maintained .
The roads are paved and well maintained , so travel by car is also not a problem , provided that one keeps a close eye out for the cows , donkeys and goats that spend much time in the middle of the road .
Botswana Railways operates Botwana &apos;s railways . The main line goes from Lobatse , near the South African border , via Gaborone to Francistown at the Zimbabwean border .
However , effective April 1 , 2009 , all passenger services have been withdrawn .
The language of business in Botswana is English and most people speak it , although in the more rural areas many people do not speak English , particularly the older generations .
Botswana &apos;s currency is the Pula ; 100 Thebe = 1 Pula . In Setswana , pula means &quot; rain &quot; and thebe means &quot; shield .
Nevertheless , crime has been on the rise over the past several years , so always be aware of your surroundings . Basic common sense will keep you safe from the predatory wildlife in rural areas .
Botswana &apos;s HIV infection rate , estimated at 24.1 % &#91; 6 &#93; , is the 2ND highest reported in the world . Exercise regular universal precautions when dealing with any bodily fluid and remain aware of this high rate of infection .
Wear rubber gloves when dressing someone else &apos;s cut , even if they are a child , and obviously NEVER , EVER HAVE UNPROTECTED SEX . If you form a serious relationship , consider both getting an HIV test before taking things further .

Lao Airlines &#91; 8 &#93; - Small airline with 4 flights a week to / from Luang Prabang in Laos , also from Vientiane and from Phnom Penh .
Trains to Nanning , China depart from Gia Lam station , about 5 km north of Hanoi station .
All other trains use the main Hanoi train station ( Ga Hang Co , 120 Le Duan , tel : 825 3949 ) , for daily services from cities in the south including Hue and Nha Trang .
Tickets for all destinations are sold in the main station , though there are two counter halls , north and south , serving the respective destinations .
Buy your tickets as early as possible , especially since sleeper ##AT##-##AT## tickets can be sold out several days in advance .
If you can &apos;t get a ticket anymore , try a travel ##AT##-##AT## agent who still might have stocks . You may also try your luck in the station just before boarding time , agents still holding tickets will be eager to sell as the departure draws near .
Nevertheless , travel agencies in Hanoi are known for their bad business practices .
Some of them will try to overcharge you up to 300 % , so it is better go to the train station by yourself and find out about the prices before you agree on any deal .
Most of the &quot; open ##AT##-##AT## tour &quot; bus itineraries either begin or end in Hanoi , with Hue the next ( or previous ) stop ( 12 ##AT##-##AT## 14 hours , US $ 8 ##AT##-##AT## 9 ) , and from there to Hoi An , Nha Trang , Dalat , Mui Ne , Ho Chi Minh City , and other cities in Vietnam , depending on the bus company .
Many of the same companies also sell tickets to Vientiane and Savannakhet in Laos ( US $ 16 ##AT##-##AT## 18 ) , but do some research before you buy a ticket - rattle ##AT##-##AT## trap scam buses abound on this route .
Taxis are the best way to travel long distances , but the cyclos , or pedicabs , are a cheap way to make shorter trips .
Taxi fares are not always consistent , and the rates for each taxi company have not been standardized .
For lone travelers , rides on the back of motorbikes ( actually low ##AT##-##AT## powered scooters ) are popular too ( known as xe om , literally meaning motorbike ##AT##-##AT## hug ) .
Be very careful with meter taxis in Hanoi .
Some have central locking , and are known to lock passengers in , and demand large amounts of US dollars before letting them go .
The driver may threaten to have you beaten up or arrested should you not give in to his demands , but if you kick up enough of a fuss , they will let you go .
Motorbike drivers can be found on virtually every corner , especially in the Old Quarter . Expect to be offered a ride every half ##AT##-##AT## block ( or more ) .
Negotiate a fare in advance , and again , turn around and walk away if you don &apos;t like their offer . There are far more drivers than tourists , and they know it - your fare could be the only one they get all day .
You might want to write down the negotiated fare to avoid confusion . Even if you do speak Vietnamese , a driver might pretend that you said 50,000 dong instead of 15,000 !
Many drivers will accept US dollars as well . At the end of a ride , some will offer to hang around to drive you to your next destination - GET A PRICE IN ADVANCE , or you might be surprised when the driver demands several million dong for two 10 minute rides .
Keep your wallet out of arms reach of the drivers when you pay , less honest motorbike drivers are not adverse to grabbing your wallet and helping themselves to any notes they like the look of before jumping on their bike and speeding off .
Negotiate first or avoid using the cyclos services , they demand 200,000VND ( US $ 12 ) for a short ride of less than 100 metres .
At the end of the journey , a few men will come over to translate , and they will pretend to help and later insist that you pay the demanded amount .
Motorcycles can be rented for around US $ 5 ##AT##-##AT## 6 a day , and can be arranged by most hotels . This is good for making lots of trips around the city for individuals or duos , but be careful : Hanoi traffic is very difficult place to sharpen motorbike skills .
Park on the sidewalk with other bikes , and be sure to lock the front wheel . Locals will help arrange the bikes near their stores .
Scam free , cheap but a bit difficult to comprehend at first , the buses in Hanoi are relatively fast and surprisingly comfortable . Pick up a map with printed bus lines at the Trang Tien street ( the book street by the Opera house ) and spend a few minutes to identify the over 60 bus lines , find your bus stop , wait for the bus , pay 3000 dong and of you go .
Ho Chi Minh Mausoleum ( Open mornings only , 8 ##AT##-##AT## 11AM ; closed on afternoons , Mondays , and Fridays . Apparently closed October ##AT##-##AT## December for maintenance of the body .
) The city down south may have his name , but only Hanoi has the man himself , entombed in distinctly Lenin ##AT##-##AT## esque fashion - against his wishes , but that &apos;s how it goes . No talking , short pants , or other signs of disrespect allowed while viewing ; photos are allowed only from outside , in the grand Ba Dinh Square .
Purses are allowed into the tomb , but expect them to be searched by several bored soldiers along the way . Left luggage is handled in a complicated scheme : there is an office near the street for large bags , with separate windows for Vietnamese and foreigners , and a further office for cameras , which will be transported to a third office right outside the exit of the mausoleum .
Right around the corner , this gleaming white museum and its gloriously ham ##AT##-##AT## handed iconography are the perfect chaser to the solemnity of the mausoleum . The building , completed in 1990 , is intended to evoke a white lotus .
One of the more informative museums in Vietnam , and perhaps one of the oddest in the world . Guides are available in English , French , Chinese and Russian , but don &apos;t bother ; the displays are labeled in English and French , and it &apos;s hard to imagine the guides doing much other than belaboring the point .
The exit from the mausoleum takes you right into the grounds of the , uh , vestige , where Ho Chi Minh lived and worked from 1954 until his death in 1969 . The nicely landscaped complex includes two of Ho Chi Minh &apos;s houses , kept shiny and &quot; as he left them &quot; by the authorities , as well as a garage with two of Ho &apos;s cars and a carp ##AT##-##AT## filled pond .
One ##AT##-##AT## Pillar Pagoda &amp; MDASH ; Tucked away between the Ho Chi Minh Mausoleum and Museum .
Travelers find the One ##AT##-##AT## Pillar Pagoda either charming and lovely or utterly pointless , depending on how many tour groups are crammed into the small grounds at the time of their visit .
Temple of Literature ( Văn Miếu ) ( On Quoc Tu Giam St. , south of the Mausoleum .
The Temple of Literature was founded in 1070 and established as the country &apos;s first university six years later .
The courtyard features numerous stone tablets , each mounted on the back of a tortoise , with the names of graduates .
National Museum of Vietnamese History ( Bảo tàng Lịch sử Việt Nam ) , No. 1 , Trang Tien Street ( Admission 15,000 dong / Students 8,000 and under 15 just 2,000 .
Hours : 8AM ##AT##-##AT## 11 : 30AM and from 1 : 30PM ##AT##-##AT## 4 : 30PM . This is a collection from Vietnamese history from about 1000 years back until 1945 .
Many antiques and the such . From 1945 onwards , you can go to the Museum of the Vietnamese Revolution located just a five minute walk away .
Museum of the Vietnamese Revolution ( Bảo tàng Cách mạng Việt Nam ) , 25 Tong Dan Street ( and 216 Tran Quang Khai Street ) Open every day except Monday , from 8AM to 11 : 45AM and from 1 : 30PM to 4 : 15PM Admission 10,000 dong .
This museum gives a very informed and detailed account of the Vietnamese struggle against first the French ( starting in 1858 -- on the first floor ) , then against the Americians ( on the ground floor - ending on 30 April 1975 ) .
Hoan Kiem means &quot; returned sword &quot; , and the name comes from a legend in which King Le Loi was given a magical sword by the gods , which he used to drive out the invading Chinese . Later , while boating on the lake , he encountered a giant turtle , who grabbed the sword and carried it down to its depths , returning it to the gods from whom it had come .
Hoa Lo Prison ( &quot; The Hanoi Hilton &quot; ) , 1 Hoa Lo , Hoan Kiem , Hanoi .
Open 8 : 30AM to 11 : 30AM and 1 : 30PM to 4 : 30PM , admission 5,000 dong .
This prison was built by the French at the turn of the 20th century , in classical French prison design .
This is where the French imprisoned and executed many of the Vietnamese freedom fighters . The prison was also used to hold U.S. prisoners of war .
Now a museum ( 2 / 3 of the prison was torn down to make way for the Hanoi Towers ) , the museum exhibits the brutal French colonial regime and the struggle of the Vietnamese people against imperialism in chilling detail .
B ##AT##-##AT## 52 Lake - Huu Tiep Lake - Ngoc Ha Precinct , Ba Dinh District — Until December 19 , 1972 , this was just a small brackish pond just off Hoang Hoa Tam Street , about 1km west of the mausoleum .
On that day , in a twisted retelling of the Hoan Kiem legend ( see above ) , Vietnamese anti ##AT##-##AT## aircraft guns ( possibly with the help of flying turtles ) retook the enemy &apos;s eight ##AT##-##AT## engined , 100 ##AT##-##AT## ton sword and sent it too , to the shallow bottom of the lake , where it remains today .
Sit on a plastic chair in front of one of the Bia Hoi ( fresh beer ) establishments which are invariably situated on the corners of many of Hanoi &apos;s &apos; Old Quarter &apos; streets .
This preservative ##AT##-##AT## free light beer is the perfect drink to sip as you watch the city &apos;s frenetic life bustle by .
The beer costs less than twenty cents and gives you an excuse to relax and take photos of the passing local characters . Should not be missed .
Moreover , once you reach the Old Quarter , you will find that almost every corner is filled with stalls selling Pho ( Vietnamese noodle ) and cafe ( the name is not limited only to coffee , but also tea , sweets and grocery items , and yes , even to Pho ! ) .
Since the mid 90s , Vietnamese cuisine has been catching up again and is now very diverse and most delicious .
Small hotel in the Old Quarter . The rooms have comfortable beds , amazing hot water pressure for showers and good air ##AT##-##AT## con / fan combos .

With a successful steel , finance and high technology industry , a strategic location at the heart of Western Europe , more natural beauty than you might expect given its size , and as one of the top 3 richest countries in the world , Luxembourg enjoys a very high standard of living .
Overrun by Germany in both World Wars , Luxembourg was one of the major battlefields of the Battle of the Bulge in the winter of 1944 ##AT##-##AT## 1945 , a story well documented in the museum at Diekirch . The state ended its neutrality in 1948 when it entered into the Benelux Customs Union and when it joined NATO the following year .
Luxembourg ##AT##-##AT## Findel International Airport ( IATA : LUX ) ( ICAO : ELLX ) &#91; 2 &#93; is located 6km outside Luxembourg ##AT##-##AT## City . It is served by Luxair &#91; 3 &#93; , the national airline , which flies to many EU countries ( including Milan and London Gatwick and City ) and Dublin , and Air France ( Paris ; actually a Luxair codeshare ) , KLM ( Amsterdam ) , Swiss ( Zurich ) , Lufthansa ( Frankfurt ; actually a Luxair codeshare ) and British Airways ( London Gatwick ) .
Alternative airports , especially for low ##AT##-##AT## cast carriers , include Ryanair hub Hahn ( aka &quot; Frankfurt ##AT##-##AT## Hahn &quot; ) , about two hours away by direct Flibco bus &#91; 5 &#93; , Zweibrücken Airport &#91; 6 &#93; and Brussels -South Charleroi , served by bus company charleroiexpress.com &#91; 7 &#93; .
Luxembourg train station can be reached directly from Paris ( 2 hours ) , Metz ( 1 hour ) , Brussels ( 3 hours ) and Trier ( 43 min ) .
Both international and national timetables can be found on the website of the national railways company CFL &#91; 8 &#93; .
Motorways from Metz ( A3 ) , Brussels ( A6 ) and Trier ( A1 ) connect to the ring ##AT##-##AT## road around Luxembourg City , from which most other parts of the country can be reached .
If you want to enjoy a nice view to the city , &quot; Grund &quot; and Kasematten , leave the motorway coming from the East ( Germany ) at exit &quot; Cents &quot; . Enter Cents and drive down the hill .
Aside from the airport buses listed above , sometimes there are commuter buses to Trier and Bitburg .
The train is a far preferable option for entering the country from nearby .
Luxembourg being a landlocked country , it &apos;s extremely hard to get in by boat .
But if you really want to there are boat links form the German side of the Moselle river to the Luxembourg side , but it is easier walking over the bridges .
Luxembourg is a compact country and it &apos;s possible to reach most any place in the country from the capital in under an hour .
The central railway station has a handy Mobiliteit &#91; 9 &#93; office that will help to plan your trip with bus and train .
The Chemins de Fer Luxembourgeois ( CFL ) &#91; 10 &#93; train network is either comprehensive or spartan , depending whether you want to go south or north . While the south is reasonably well covered , the north is limited to one main line ( Ligne 10 ) which runs from Luxembourg City via Mersch , Ettelbrück , Wilwerwiltz , Clervaux and Troisvierges .
To the south you can reach Bettembourg and Esch ##AT##-##AT## sur ##AT##-##AT## Alzette . There is also a line to the east which crosses into Germany over the Moselle River at Wasserbillig .
The same tickets are valid on trains as buses , and the same rates apply : € 1.50 for two hours ( unlimited transfers ) or € 4.00 for one day . A € 40 month ticket can be purchased at the CFL office under Hamilius , at some newsagencies or at the station .
From an aesthetic view , perhaps the best way to approach Luxembourg City is by train from the north via Ligne 10 as this is a beautifully scenic route past some of the most well ##AT##-##AT## known Luxembourgish sights .
Within the city , the comprehensive bus service is more than adequate for the average tourist .
Buses numbered 1 ##AT##-##AT## 25 serve the Ville de Luxembourg , with the most useful being the 16 ( Town to the Airport via Kirchberg ) and the 18 ( Town to Kirchberg and Auchan ) .
Almost all buses include the central bus station Hamilius ( centre of town ) and the Station ( Luxembourg Gare ) in their routes at some point .
Any bus pointing stationwards from Hamilius will probably take you there ( the 3 being a notable exception ) .
Bus tickets ( which are also valid on trains ) are available from the driver . A standard ticket costs € 1.50 and will be valid on any bus up to 2 hours after its purchase .
Every village has a convenient bus service which runs at least once every hour .
Buses numbered 100 upwards will take you out of the city .
Useful routes to the north of the country include the 100 ( Diekirch via Junglinster , every hour ) , the 120 ( Junglinster , every 30 minutes ) and the 290 ( Mersch , frequent ) .
Town buses experienced a reduced service on Saturdays ( including those used mainly by shoppers ) , and many routes are barely existent ( if at all ) on a Sunday .
This doesn &apos;t matter , though , since most shops and attractions are closed on a Sunday .
Almost all national buses run the same on Saturdays ( which count as working days in this instance ) as during the week , but the Sunday service is usually reduced or non ##AT##-##AT## existent .
Luxembourg &apos;s road infrastructure is well ##AT##-##AT## developed if not always very well thought ##AT##-##AT## out .
Anywhere that happens to lie along the major motorways is easily accessible via these ( including Grevenmacher in the east , Mamer to the west and Bettembourg to the south ) .
Esch ##AT##-##AT## Alzette , the country &apos;s second city ( more like a small town by international standards ) has its own motorway link , the A4 .
In addition , a new motorway is being built towards the north of the country ( Mersch , Ettelbrück ) , but this won &apos;t be completed until 2010 at the earliest .
However , the current North Road provides easy access to these areas for the moment .
Current national speed limits are 50km / h in towns and villages , 90km / h on open country roads ( 110 in some places on N7 and N11 ) , and 130km / h on the motorway ( 110 in the rain ) . 70km / h also exists in some places .
Be aware that if you have a right ##AT##-##AT## hand ##AT##-##AT## drive car then you are very likely to be singled out for a customs check on the way in . Police are also very keen on stopping drivers for having the &apos; wrong &apos; lights on in town , i.e.
Finding parking in Luxembourg city centre on the weekends is a pain .
Most parking spaces are quickly taken and some parking garages close early .
The best option is to find somewhere near the station and then walk around the city centre . Traffic wardens are also numerous and vigilant .
The streets and landscape in Luxembourg make for good biking territory ; highly recommended .
Be wary , though , of small ##AT##-##AT## ish bicycle repair shops in rural corners of the country -- they may quite well charge you quite some money for fixing your bike when they actually break it , more or less subtly .
For bicycle repairs , neighboring Trier ( with a considerable University student population ) is usually a safer bet .
Hence , again knowing French is your best bet if you want to converse with most people , especially as people working in shops and bars usually come from France or Belgium and don &apos;t bother to learn the local native language . English is widely understood by such personnel as bus drivers , but many shop assistants will only respond if addressed in French .
Luxembourg uses the euro , so there is no need to change money if coming in from Belgium , France or Germany .
If you know any coin collectors , take a few local coins as keepsakes , since Luxembourgish coins are among the rarest of the euros — even in Luxembourg , most of your change will be in other countries &apos; coins !
In most restaurants however , the typical local food would be French cuisine coming in bigger portions .
Italian food has been popular since the 1960s .
Home cooking has been very influenced by the recipes of Ketty Thull , apparently the best ##AT##-##AT## selling cooking and baking book in Luxembourg since WW II .
The Luxembourg white wines from the Moselle valley to the east of Luxembourg include Riesling , Pinot Gris , Pinot Blanc , Rivaner and Elbling to name just a few and are good .
Young people tend to drink local or imported beer . Luxembourg has a number of breweries , with Diekirch , from the village of the same name , Bofferding , Battin , and Mousel being the most popular .
Despite the fact that you would be hard pushed to find any of these outside of the country , all are excellent lagers .
Thanks to the heavy banking and EU presence in the city , hotels in central Luxembourg are quite expensive , although there is a good youth hostel ( see Luxembourg ( city ) # Sleep ) .
It may be more cost ##AT##-##AT## effective to stay across the border in eg .
Trier and &quot; commute &quot; into Luxembourg , as a day ##AT##-##AT## ticket valid for a return trip and free run of the entire country is only € 8.40 .
A number of smaller hotels in Luxembourg , mostly in the countryside but including a few in the city , have banded together at hotels.lu &#91; 11 &#93; .
Many thousands of people commute from neighbouring Belgium , France ( Les frontaliers ) and Germany on week days , considerably swelling the population of the capital city . The majority work in the numerous financial institutions based in the capital and are drawn across the borders by the excellent salaries on offer .
Luxembourg City has a very international flavour as in addition to les frontaliers , it attracts young professionals from all over the globe .
In this area , business is done predominently in English , French or German and it is necessary to be fluent in one of these as a minimum although many jobs will demand proficiency in at least two .
In many surveys , Luxembourg has been named &quot; safest country in the world &quot; .
The food and tap water supply in Luxembourg is perfectly fine and the country &apos;s healthcare system is first ##AT##-##AT## class .
The climate is average even though the summers can get hot . However these temperatures only rarely rise much above 30 ° C.
Try to show respect for the local language and make some effort to say a word or two of it even if it &apos;s just the standard greeting &quot; Moien &quot; .

Namibia &#91; 1 &#93; is in Southern Africa , bordering South Africa , Botswana , Angola , Zambia and the Atlantic Ocean . Formerly a colony of Germany , Namibia was administered by South Africa under a League of Nations mandate after WWI , and annexed as a province of South Africa after WWII .
The South ##AT##-##AT## West African People &apos;s Organization ( SWAPO ) launched a guerrilla war for independence in 1966 , but did not gain independence until 1990 .
Namibia boasts remarkable natural attractions such as the Namib desert , the Fish River Canyon Park , Etosha National Park and the Kalahari desert .
Its people speak nine different languages , including some of the Khoisan languages which include the &apos; clicks &apos; that present an enigma to most native English ##AT##-##AT## speakers . Namibia produces some of the world &apos;s highest quality diamonds .
Swakopmund -- Coastal town , a mecca for Namibians on holiday .
Tsumeb -- Mining town east of Etosha .
Brandberg Mountains -- The highest mountain in Namibia at 2 573 m .
Skeleton Coast -- The northern coastal part of the Namib desert , named for the dozens of ships that were beached in the thick fog that is frequent where the desert meets the Atlantic .
Tourists may enter Namibia for up to 3 months .
Namibia ( along with Lesotho , South Africa and Swaziland ) is a member of the Southern African Common Monetary Area and as such the Namibian Dollar ( NAD ) is pegged 1 : 1 to the South African Rand ( ZAR ) .
Both the Namibian Dollar and South African Rand is legal tender in Namibia though change will usually be given in Namibian Dollars .
Banks in Namibia will convert Namibian Dollars for South African Rand and vice versa without charge or paperwork .
Since any bank or currency exchange outside Namibia ( including other members of the Common Monetary Area ) will charge a substantial service fee to change currency , it is advisable to make use of a Namibian Bank before leaving the country .
It is also advisable to carry proof ( for example ATM receipts ) that money you are taking out of the country is money that you brought into the country in the first place .
Automated teller machines are available in Windhoek , Swakopmund , Luderitz , Tsumeb , and other towns and cities .
It is best to use only teller machines that are inside a mall or other building .
Always be careful to make sure no one is watching you enter your PIN , and be vigilant about typical scams ( e.g.
machines that seem to eat your card and won &apos;t give it back after you enter the PIN ) .
Prices in shops are fixed , but prices in open markets or from street vendors are open to barter .
Vegetarians need not apply . Namibians have a very high intake of meat .
It is possible to be a vegetarian in Namibia , however , as there are some Peace Corps workers who live there for two years and remain vegetarian throughout .
you will find local and international cuisine in the many diverse restaurants and cafes .
3 course gourmet dinners on red dune under the stars accompanied with staff entertainment NS 220 pp .
A hotel provides accommodation to the traveling public , has a reception area and offers at least a &quot; breakfast room &quot; or communal eating area .
In general a hotel makes food and beverage services available to a guest , though these may be outsourced or provided by the hotel .
The HIV infection rate in Namibia is about 25 % .
Namibia &apos;s medical system is modern and capable of attending to whatever needs you may have .
Staff are well trained and so HIV transmission in hospitals is not an issue .
This applies to government and private hospitals alike , though line ##AT##-##AT## ups are often shorter at private hospitals , and there have been cases of incorrect diagnosis in government hospitals .
Namibia &apos;s water supply is usually safe to drink , except where labelled otherwise .
Campsites next to rivers often get their water directly from the river , so do not drink it !
Having said all this , make sure you consult a physician specializing in health issues of Southern Africa , as well as things like the Centre for Disease Control &#91; 17 &#93; web page . Make sure you satisfy yourself of the safety of anything you &apos;re getting into .
It is a well developed country ( albeit still a developing nation ) with all the modern amenities and technologies . Don &apos;t show up wearing khaki shorts and a safari hat ; people will laugh .
In fact , Namibians refer to this kind of tourist as The Khakis in a derogative manner . And if you ask where the &apos; real &apos; Africa is ( i.e. , the Africa of Tarzan ) , Namibians may very well be offended .
It is customary when greeting someone to ask them how they &apos;re doing . It &apos;s a simple exchange where each person asks &quot; How are you ?
&quot; ) and responds with a correspondingly short answer , and then proceed with whatever your business is about . It &apos;s a good idea to do this at tourist info booths , in markets , when getting into taxis , even in shops in Windhoek ( though it &apos;s normally not done in some of the bigger stores in the malls ) .
Each city or region has a two ##AT##-##AT## digit area code . When calling long distance within Namibia , prefix the area code with a &apos; 0&apos; .
Mobile phones are very common and run on the GSM network , using the same frequency as Europe and the rest of Africa .
There are Internet cafes in Windhoek , Swakopmund and Opuwo , and hostels often have access as well .
Namibia has two GSM cellular phone operators , MTC &#91; 18 &#93; and CellOne &#91; 19 &#93; and both offer prepaid options .
Starter packs and airtime vouchers are readily available at most stores .

Normandy &#91; 1 &#93; ( French : Normandie ) is a region of northern France , bordering the English Channel .
Normandy is famed for the D ##AT##-##AT## Day Allied invasion on June 6 , 1944 .
You can choose to go the whole way if you can walk for a month ! Otherwise select day trips or 2 ##AT##-##AT## 3 days trips in the most interesting parts : History fans will choose the D ##AT##-##AT## Day beaches , while lovers of spectacular nature ( cliffs and coves ) will walk around la Cap de la Hague , west of Cherbourg , or choose to walk to Mont Saint Michel .
Weather in Normandy can be unpredictable but is often very nice . One of the best seasons to visit Normandy is September .

Chinatown ##AT##-##AT## North Beach in San Francisco combines two adjoining neighbors , both of whom are among the city &apos;s most popular immigrant neighborhoods . Culturally and aesthetically , they could not be more different yet their streets mesh seamlessly together .
This &quot; Little Italy , &quot; with its cafes and alfresco dining , has a real European charm and flavor reminiscent of the romance of Europe and Italy . The area runs from roughly Bay Street to the north , Columbus Avenue and Powell Street on the west , San Francisco Bay on the east , and Washington Street on the south with an extension to Sutter Street between Kearny and Powell Streets to encompass the rest of Chinatown .
Many of the Chinese who settled here were merchants or immigrant workers , working on either the transcontinental railroad or as mine workers during the Gold Rush . Today , it is home for more than 15,000 Chinese and Chinese ##AT##-##AT## Americans , many of whom are low ##AT##-##AT## income , elderly , and foreign born , living in dense tenements .
Chinatown holds a prominent position in the history of Chinese and Chinese ##AT##-##AT## Americans in the United States , from the Chinese Exclusion Act of 1882 to the present day . The residual &quot; bachelor &quot; society one finds in San Francisco &apos;s Chinatown today cannot be understood without some knowledge of these hostile decades .
The Chinatown market area is mainly along Stockton Street , one block above ( west of ) Grant Avenue , and the east ##AT##-##AT## west streets crossing Stockton . Other San Francisco concentrations of Chinese shops and restaurants are located in the Inner Richmond District , mainly along Clement , and the Outer Sunset District , mainly along Irving .
Forming part of the old Barbary Coast ( an extinct neighborhood infamous for its crime , prostitution , and general unruliness ) , and popular with both locals and tourists alike , North Beach remains one of the most popular and beloved neighborhoods in San Francisco . Nestled between Chinatown to the south and Fisherman &apos;s Wharf to the north , North Beach is the Italian part of town and is known by the moniker &quot; Little Italy .
The neighborhood derived its name as the bay shoreline originally reached as far as Taylor and Francisco streets , and the area was indeed a real beach until the city subsequently filled it in . The portion of Grant Avenue that runs straight through North Beach is the oldest street in San Francisco .
North Beach was also the West Coast &apos;s capital for the Beatnik movement in the 1950s — you can still see many of the places where Jack Kerouac and the &quot; Dharma Bums &quot; hung out and wrote their dark poetry . Other literati celebrities that hung out there were ; Alan Ginsberg , Neal Cassidy ( Dean Moriarity in Kerouac &apos;s On The Road ) , and Lawrence Ferlinghetti .
&quot; The area is still full of adult bookstores and strip clubs ; despite this , strangely , like everything in San Francisco , it retains a certain charm . Washington Square ( another old Beat hangout ) , in front of the Saints Peter and Paul Church , is a very popular hangout with locals , and a great place to relax .
Driving into the area is not recommended , but if you must , the closest parking garage to Chinatown is underneath Portsmouth Plaza , on Kearny Street ( which is a one ##AT##-##AT## way street north ) between Clay and Washington .
Other Chinatown garages are the Golden Gateway at 250 Clay Street , North Beach at 755 Vallejo Street , and St. Mary &apos;s Square at 433 Kearny Street .
All garages are open 24 hours a day , except for Golden Gateway . There are also a few small parking garages scattered throughout North Beach , including Imperial Parking at 425 Broadway Street .
Driving to the base of Coit Tower is definitely not recommended , as there is a very limited amount of parking at the top of the hill .
Both routes will take you into Chinatown , but the Powell ##AT##-##AT## Mason line is a better bet for getting to North Beach as the Powell ##AT##-##AT## Hyde line turns west at Jackson and proceeds into Russian Hill . To reach Chinatown &apos;s famous Grant Avenue via the cable car , exit BART or the MUNI Metro at the Embarcadero Station and catch the California cable car line at California and Market .

Tourist visas are no longer required for citizens of the European Union , United States , Canada , Japan , Switzerland , Liechtenstein , Andorra , Vatican City , Monaco , Iceland , Norway , San Marino , Mongolia , Serbia , Montenegro and the countries of the Commonwealth of Independent States ( except Turkmenistan ) .
This applies only for tourist travel lasting less than 90 days .
Customs officials might inquire about the amount being brought into the country . It is prohibited to bring large amounts of Ukrainian currency ( hryvnia ) in to the country unless it was declared upon leaving Ukraine .
It is advisable to check in advance the customs regulations ( e.g.
When entering the country you will be required to complete an immigration form - currently this is a simple white document with two parts that have more or less identical information . Both parts should be completed on arrival : the immigration officer will keep one part and you have to retain the second , which you will need to show to the immigration officer on your departure from the country .
It is not advisable to lose this easily lost scrap of paper , as you &apos;ll almost certainly have difficulties on leaving Ukraine ( and likely incur a &quot; fine &quot; too ) . You will need to know where you are going to stay as this is required on the form and the immigration officer will insist that it is filled in .
Special offers on flights come and go , depending on the whim of the carrier . Recently the low ##AT##-##AT## cost airline Wizzair started operations within Ukraine and will start one international route from Kyiv to London Luton airport in December 2008 .
There are several airlines which offer direct flights to cities like Dnipropetrovsk ( Lufthansa ) , Donetsk ( Lufthansa , Austrian ) , Odessa ( MALEV , LOT , Austrian , CSA Czech Airlines ) , Kharkiv and Lviv ( LOT , Austrian Airlines ) , but they are more expensive .
Planes used are newer Boeing 737 and 767 aircraft . Ukraine International also recently introduced flights within the country from its hub in Kyiv , mainly flying newer Boeing 737 aircraft .
One can enter Ukraine by train &#91; 2 &#93; from any land ##AT##-##AT## bordering neighbor .
When coming from Western Europe there will be a wait at the border while the train &apos;s bogies are changed in order to adapt to a different rail gauge .
It &apos;s generally quicker and cheaper to buy a ticket to the border and then change trains , rather than wait getting through train .
Generally , in Ukraine railway travel is much cheaper than flying , and is comparable ( but probably cheaper ) to bus or car travel .
It will take at most a whole day to ride across the country , so unless you are in hurry take a train .
It &apos;s good practice to take long ##AT##-##AT## distance trains , which are much more comfortable .
Avoid cheap third ##AT##-##AT## class travel if you &apos;re cautious of local experiences .
The nearest significant town on the Polish side is Przemyśl , and it &apos;s straightford to find by following route # 4 ( which passes through Przemyśl ) , also known as the E40 in European terms .
When you arrive , the road is fairly narrow ( no motorway / autobahn this ) with a queue of trucks and vans parked to the right of the road ; a hard ##AT##-##AT## core parking area with cafe / bar to the left .
Don &apos;t stop behind the goods vehicles , slip up the side of them and then feed into the customs area when the guy flags you forward ( for courteous Europeans , you &apos;re not jumping the queue - commercial traffic goes through a different process ) .
If you &apos;re in an EU registered car then make for the EU ##AT##-##AT## passports , passport control section . Thence to Ukrainian passport control and then Ukrainian customs and then you &apos;re through .
It used to be a nightmare , with apocalyptic tales of 5 ##AT##-##AT## 6 + hours at the border ( and as of July 2007 , this is still a possibility ) , but the Ukrainians have made great advances in efficiency and it takes about an hour to make the crossing ( September 2005 - still true in Feb 2006 ) .
Don &apos;t expect the border police to treat you in a friendly or even respectful manner , in fact , expect anything ranging from neutral to extremely dickish behavior .
Once through , just follow the main road towards Lviv on the E40 - this is the route right across Ukraine to Kyiv ( and thence on to the East ) . Stick to this - the main towns on the way are Lviv , Rivne , Zhytomyr .
You can walk across the 200 meter long bridge from Sighetul Marmatiei , Romania . But once you get to Slatina , Ukraine , it may be difficult to engage onward travel unless you came in a car .
Bicycling is also a possibility in summer .
There are inexpensive direct bus services to Lviv and Ivano ##AT##-##AT## Frankivsk from Poland .
There are some ferries from Istanbul , Georgia , Varna ( Bulgaria ) to Odessa or to Crimea .
The signs are all in Ukrainian ( Cyrillic alphabet ) . Only a few signs ( every 200km or so ) are written in the Latin alphabet , and indicate main cities .
You are strongly advised to respect the signs , especially speed limits . Be aware that unlike in Western countries , where limits are repeated several times , in Ukraine , an obligation or a prohibition is often indicated on a single sign , which you must not miss .
Speed in cities is limited to 60km / h ( 40mph ) .
Speed on highways is limited to 110 ##AT##-##AT## 120km / h ( 75mph ) .
Be aware that corruption is widespread among Ukrainian police , and tourists are an especially profitable target . When you are stopped for speeding or other offenses , officers might aggressively try and extract ridiculous sums of money from you ( € 100 and up ) , offering &quot; reductions &quot; if you pay on the spot ( the proposed alternative being some unpleasant and more expensive way , all made up ) .
If you mention that , they &apos;ll let you off the hook quicker than you know it . At any rate , write down the officers &apos; badge numbers , rank , plate number of the police car , and notify the nearest embassy / consulate in detail , to help fight these corrupt practices .
Fuel is no longer a problem in Ukraine , especially for those who remember travelling to Ukraine during the early 1990s , when gasoline was considered precious . Today , there are plenty service stations .
There are varying types of fuel , such as diesel , unleaded 95 octane , and ( more rarely ) unleaded 98 octane ; one finds also 80 and 76 octane . Note that if you choose to fill ##AT##-##AT## up in a rural filling station , you will need to pay first , and in cash .
The main roads are okay for all cars , as long as you don &apos;t go too fast .
Numerous running repairs have created a patchwork road surface , and it will seriously test your suspension - even on the major dual carriageways .
Secondary roads are passable , but beware : certain zones can be full of potholes and you must treat them with extra care , or avoid them entirely .
Roads between villages are often little more than dirt tracks and not metalled .
Treat as inaccessible unless you &apos;re driving a 4x4 .
Road works have been ongoing , but the quality of the roads is shy of Western Europe ( with the exception of Kyiv ) ...
Be careful when driving in towns or villages .
Sometimes pets prefer to walk on the road , and they are a hazard for all drivers .
You &apos;re likely to see plenty of animals hit by cars , so be prepared ...
Also , don &apos;t be surprised to see plenty of horse drawn carts - even on the dual carriageways .
There are two major bus companies that run buses from all of the major cities to and from Kyiv , they are Avtolux , and Gunsel .
Prices run about 55 ##AT##-##AT## 70 Hryvnia ( 11 ##AT##-##AT## 13 USD ) for service to Dnipropetrovsk and Kharkiv .
The major advantage that the bus service has , is that it leaves from Boryspil and stops in Kyiv , so if your destination is not Kyiv , its easier then taking a bus to the Main Passenger Railway Station in Kyiv .
Aerosvit offers cheap flights and is a time ##AT##-##AT## saving alternative to the slow and inefficient train service .
For example the flight Odesa ##AT##-##AT## Kyiv ( One ##AT##-##AT## Way ) is ~ 180 USD ( including Tax &amp; all fees ) and takes 1.5 hours . However , be sure to book early for the cheapest fares .
The flights can be booked online via www.aerosvit.ua , comfortably in English .
WizzAir , as of early 2009 , offers flights between Lviv , Kyiv and Simferopol at competitive prices .
It &apos;s possible to go by hitchhiking - usually cargo trucks will take you for free - but it &apos;s still worth to try stop personal cars as well .
Good people are everywhere ; you may be picked up in a Lada or a Lexus .
If you are outside a big city or in doubt about food , exercise caution and common sense about where you buy food .
Try to buy groceries only in supermarkets or large grocery stores , always check the expiration date , and never buy meat or dairy products on the street ( you can buy them on the market , but not near the market ) .
Hotels might be a traumatic experience for a westerner anywhere outside Kyiv . The cheaper the hotel , the larger the chance of some quite unfortunate surprises , especially for those not familiar with the Soviet ##AT##-##AT## style level of service which still remains in many places .
For instance in IvanoFrankivsk ( near the Carpathians ) , the going rate is approximately 35 euro for a suite ( bedroom and sitting room ) in Hotel Nadia . Many hotels have the choice between renovated rooms / suites ( &quot; western style &quot; ) and not renovated rooms ( easteuropean style ) .
There are only three 5 ##AT##-##AT## star hotels : in Kyiv called the Premier Palace and Opera , and another one in Doneck called Donbass Palace , but they are very expensive .
Two western hotels recently opened , Radisson SAS and Hyatt .
They are not on the cheap side either and are usually full , so make reservations in advance .
Another option is to rent an apartment on the Internet before you leave your country .
There &apos;s many to choose from in Kyiv and Odessa . Tip : Read Kyiv in your pocket on Internet !
What many people from ex ##AT##-##AT## soviet countries do is to go to the railway station , where they try to find people who are willing to rent a room .
Prices are usually much cheaper and if there are enough people offering the room you can make great deals ( in Yalta people are almost fighting to be able to talk to you ) .
Opposite , if being arrested by police or other law enforcement - do your best to inform them that you &apos;re a foreign visitor . Not many police officials speak foreign languages freely , however many people are eager to assist in translation .
The Euro and US dollar are generally accepted as alternative forms of currency , particularly in tourist areas .
Ukraine has some of the worst statistics for road related deaths and injuries in the world - so act accordingly .
Take care when crossing the roads ; walk and drive defensively - be aware that traffic overtakes on both the inside and outside .
Sometimes you even need to take care when using the sidewalks , as in rush ##AT##-##AT## hours the black , slab ##AT##-##AT## sided Audi / BMW / Mercedes sometimes opt to avoid the traffic by using the wide sidewalks ; pedestrians or not .
Owners / drivers of expensive cars have been known , at times , to be more careless of the safety of pedestrians . Drivers rarely grant priority to pedestrians crossing a road unless there are pedestrian lights .
Also be warned that pavements suffer in the same way as the roads in terms of collapsing infrastructure . Take care when walking , especially in the dark and away from the downtown areas of the main cities ( a torch / flashlight is a useful possession ) as the streets are poorly lit , as are most of the entries / stairwells to buildings , and the street and sidewalk surfaces are often dangerously pot ##AT##-##AT## holed .
Ukraine is by no means a conservative country with respect to clothing , behaviour , overcharging you if they can get by with it , getting what you paid for ( quality ) . It is very different from our western perspective in some of these cases .

‘ Land of a Thousand Volcanoes ’ – this unique island of spent lava fields is recognised as a World Biosphere Reserve .
But amidst this lunar like landscape are fabulous beaches , palm oases , and a cultural history that can be enjoyed throughout the year , thanks to its wonderful climate .
Known as &apos; the miniature continent &apos; , for the variety of climates and landscapes that can be found on this most developed of the seven Canary Islands .
From the big city bustle of the capital , Las Palmas , to the secluded serenity of its many beaches and lush woodlands , Gran Canarias offers a wide range of sights and activities year round .
Golf courses , yacht marinas , conference centres , theme parks , beaches ... Tenerife offers a complete range of leisure activities to satisfy all kinds of tastes .
Under the attentive gaze of El Teide , the highest mountain in Spain , and with the sea as an ever ##AT##-##AT## present backdrop , visitors can experience the rich diversity of its landscape and micro ##AT##-##AT## climates .
The unusual sight of windmills , a reminder of its farming past , can be found throughout the island , which is known as the ‘ granary of the Canary Islands ’ .
Despite its desert like landscape it has over one hundred and fifty beaches , the most extensive coastal platform of the archipelago , three thousand hours of sunshine a year and a naturally peaceful environment .
La Palma is called the &apos; Pretty Isle &apos; by Canary Islanders for its spectacularly lush vegetation , abundant clear waters and floral wealth which are in sharp contrast to the many volcanic forms that are testimony to the island &apos;s origins .
Along with the natural beauty of the island , is a culture rich in traditions , crafts and cuisine that has survived from aboriginal times for everyone to enjoy today .
La Gomera is surprisingly varied and full of contrasts ; impressive gorges , grand rock monoliths , marvellous palm groves and the Garajonay National Park , a unique ecological treasure of crystal clear waters and green laurel forests .
The natural wealth of the whole Island is so impressive that it has , in fact , won the highest possible distinction as a protected natural space .
El Hierro is a magic island , and Pozo de la Salud , a prodigious spring with curative properties , adds to the magic , as do the fascinating underwater formations seen just off the rugged coastline .
All this , plus the kind and friendly nature of the people , makes a visit to the smallest of the Canary Islands a charmed experience .

Unless you seriously want to recompile some of the drivers , there is NO reason to download any of the source archives .

New on April 5th : An updated linux kernel with support for a number of video cards not covered in the one uploaded 2 days ago is available here .
Please note that this is only for people who have such cards ; This kernel does support neither nVidia nor Matrox cards , and not VESA , either .

An error occurred during the upgrade !
What &apos;s the meaning of the messages while starting XAMPP ?
Apache doesn &apos;t seems to start . What can I do ?
What do I do if the error message is &quot; Invalid argument : Could not set permissions on ssl ##UNDERSCORE## mutex &quot; ?
What do I do if the error message is » Invalid argument : Configuration failed « ?
What do I do if the error message is » The configuration file now needs a secret passphrase ( blowfish ##UNDERSCORE## secret ) « shows up ?
After I rebooted my Linux box XAMPP stopped running ! How can I fix this ?
How can I make my XAMPP installation more secure ?
How do I backup / restore my XAMPP system ?
If you donwloaded a wrong version you will get an error message if you try to upgrade .
By the way : It doesn &apos;t matter where in the filesystem you extract the packet . Just make sure it &apos;s on the same machine as your XAMPP installation .
After unpacking the archive you can start the upgrade process .
By the way : the upgrade will stop a running XAMPP and will start XAMPP as soon as the upgrade is finished .
XAMPP will be started after an upgrade even if it was not running before .
The upgrade program carefully tried to upgrade one of your configuration files .
In order to upgrade the file , the program had to edit some lines you had already changed .
Seeing as nobody wants to lose valuable configuration information , the upgrade program decided not to change the file but save a copy of the new file in addition to the original one .
The LAMPP startup script did not start XAMPP ##AT##-##AT## Apache because there is an Apache instance already running .
To start XAMPP properly , first you have to stop this daemon .
Mostly due to the same reasons as the above error . The LAMPP startup script found a MySQL daemon already running on your system .
To start LAMPP properly , you have to stop this daemon first .
XAMPP needs a newer Linux distribution that uses the glibc 2.1 version .
Good question : ) This error can exist for multiple reasons .
If you now see &quot; Invalid argument : Could not set permissions on ssl ##UNDERSCORE## mutex &quot; or &quot; Invalid argument : Unable to create scoreboard &quot; please take a look at answers below . If you see another error message please email it to me .
In this case you have to change the Group directive ( about line 318 ) in / opt / lampp / etc / httpd.conf.
In this case you have to remove the hash ( # ) in front of the Scoreboard directive ( about line 71 ) in / opt / lampp / etc / httpd.conf.
Now this error message should not bother you anymore .
In this case , Apache is unable to get the IP address for your host name .
It should normally work but sometimes ( mostly if you &apos;re using DHCP ) this situation could happen .
Simply call the following command ( Please use copy &amp; paste .
This will fix the configuation error of your system and the » Configuration failed « error should dissapear .
This message may appear since XAMPP for Linux 1.2 was released .
Since version 2.5.2 , phpMyAdmin supports the encryption of cookie ##AT##-##AT## saved passwords .
Edit config.inc.php at line 60 . You find this file in the phpmyadmin directory of your XAMPP installation .
Since version 4 - I think - SELinux is activated by default and this is preventing the succesful start of XAMPP .
If you know a better solution , please email me . I &apos;m no SELinux expert and the only I know about SELinux is how to disable it .
That &apos;s normal Linux behaviour ( which applies to any other Unix ##AT##-##AT## like system .
It &apos;s the admin &apos;s job to make sure a particular application is started at bootup .
You should now see a line containing a number between two colons .
In most cases 3 or 5 ( 2 if you &apos;re using Debian ) .
Now XAMPP should start and stop automatically if you boot or shutdown your machine .
And than use the runlevel editor ( expert mode ) from YaST to activate XAMPP for the specific runlevels .
XAMPP : Your XAMPP pages are NOT secured by a password .
XAMPP : MySQL has no root passwort set ! !
Remove the semicolon at the beginning of each line and restart XAMPP .
Now the extension should be active .
I have only had a few chances to test this feature , so please report if this worked for you or not : oswald ##AT## apachefriends.org.
Warning : The backup and restore functionality is still under development and may not work correctly .
Where secret is your MySQL root password .
The file / opt / lampp / backup / xampp ##AT##-##AT## backup ##AT##-##AT## 22 ##AT##-##AT## 01 ##AT##-##AT## 04.sh ( in the example above ) contains your backuped data .
Get this file to a save place .
On the new machine you need the same version of XAMPP as on your original / source machine .
As you can read you may need to restart XAMPP .
It should work perfectly ( I tested it many times ) but remember it &apos;s a beta feature .

The Aro gTér is a stream of Vajrayana Buddhism in which ordination is congruous with romance , marriage , and family life .
It focuses on the teaching and practice of the Inner Tantras from the point of view Dzogchen an essential non ##AT##-##AT## dual teaching .
The Aro gTér tradition is possibly unique in its applicability to Western people .
Due to the predominance of the Dzogchen perspective , the Aro gTér emphasises : assimilation with everyday working life ; appreciative sexual equality ; the spiritual dimension of romantic relationship ; artistic creativity ; and the pursuit of life enhancing engagement with the Arts and challenging physical skill – such as equestrianism .
Students practice within the context of their ordinary lives : marrying , raising families , and engaging in the activities of life which are common to the general population .
Practitioners in the Aro tradition reside in Great Britain , North America , Austria , Germany , Switzerland , Sweden , and Finland .
The Aro gTér is a cycle of teachings revealed by the female visionary , Aro Lingma ( 1886 – 1923 ) and is based entirely in the three Inner Tantras of Nyingma Vajrayana .
The Nyingma Tradition traces its origins to the first spread of Buddhism in Tibet , to the time of the Tantric Buddhas : Padmasambhava and Yeshé Tsogyel .
Ngak ’ chang Rinpoche and Khandro Déchen are the current Lineage Holders of the Aro gTér and teach as a couple .
They make it a priority in their teaching activities to facilitate their students in viewing their relationships and family lives as key spiritual practice .
As representatives of a lineage founded by a woman , they are keen to help women become spiritual practitioners and teachers – and therefore children are always welcome on retreats .
They have encouraged the founding of three other sanghas through their disciples Ngala Rig ’ dzin Dorje and Tsalgyür Wangmo , Ngala Nor ’ dzin Pamo and Ngala ’ ö ##AT##-##AT## Dzin Tridral , and Ngakma Shardröl Du ##AT##-##AT## nyam Wangmo .
Ngala Rig ’ dzin Dorje and Tsalgyür Wangmo teach and guide their sangha in Continental Europe and Scandinavia ; Ngala Nor ’ dzin and Ngala ’ ö ##AT##-##AT## Dzin teach and guide their sangha in Britain ; and Ngakma Shardröl teaches and guides her sangha in the USA .
Ngak ’ chang Rinpoche and Khandro Déchen ’ s sangha are found in Britain and the USA .
They teach twice a year in the USA , in New York and California .
The Aro gTér Lineage has been passed down through a line of enlightened women originating with Yeshé Tsogyel and continuing to the great gTértön Khyungchen Aro Lingma ( 1886 – 1923 ) .
Ngak ’ chang Rinpoche is the incarnation of Aro Yeshé the son of Khyungchen Aro Lingma .
Aro gTér practice is entirely Inner Tantra – from the perspective of Dzogchen .
This means that yogic song , silent sitting , mantra recitation , and sKu ##AT##-##AT## mNyé ( physical yogic exercises ) play a central part in practitioners lives .
This is a colourful , energetic lineage where craft , thangka painting , namkha ( sky ##AT##-##AT## weaving ) , cham ( Tantric dance ) , Tantric orchestra , and appreciation of sensory experience are celebrated .
In comparison to other Traditions , the Aro gTér is non ##AT##-##AT## monastic and therefore far less emphasis is placed on practices such as liturgical recitation , sadhana ( rituals and detailed visualisation ) and cho ##AT##-##AT## pa ( ritual offering practices ) .
Lamas of this tradition teach according to the ethos of Dzogchen both formally and through the simple spontaneity of informal situations .
The Tibetan word Lama means not only the external teacher , but also the internal teacher – which is our beginninglessly enlightened nature .
The rôle of the Lama is to mirror the student .
This mirroring is a means of reflecting the students innate realisation – and his or her own pattern of confusion .
The Lamas therefore encourage apprentices to regard their whole lives as practice – both practically and inspirationally .
The Apprenticeship Programme developed by Ngak ’ chang Rinpoche and Khandro Déchen is an effective method of working with students who are seriously interested in the practices of the Aro gTér .
Apprentices practise under the direction of their Lamas .
Guidance and transmission are given through : dynamic personal instruction ; group question and answer sessions ; shared meditation ; yogic song ; and , by being amongst their apprentices .
Apprentices who have studied and practised with the Aro Lamas for five years have the opportunity to take ngakpa / ngakma or naljorpa / naljorma ordination .
Both ordinations are for those who have realistically come to regard the Lamas as their root teachers ( Tsa ##AT##-##AT## wa ’ i Lamas ) .
Ordination is for those who regard the tradition , lineage , and practice as the most important part of their lives .
The Aro gTér lineage follows the Vajrayana gö ##AT##-##AT## kar chang ##AT##-##AT## lo style of practice which emphasises transformation .
Its practitioners are known by their white skirts and uncut hair .
The Vajrayana path of transformation is well suited to people who are inspired to practice using their everyday life circumstances as the path to realisation .
At the encouragement of Kyabjé Düdjom Rinpoche , Ngak ’ chang Rinpoche and Khandro Déchen have established an ordained gö ##AT##-##AT## kar chang ##AT##-##AT## lo sangha in the West .
Sixty students have taken this step ( as of 2006 ) , and others are working toward it .
There are now three strong gö ##AT##-##AT## kar chang ##AT##-##AT## lo sanghas in the West and it is established that this lineage of ordination will continue to grow under the guidance of their Lamas .
At the Ordination Retreat in Baarlo , Netherlands in January 2000 , sixteen apprentices took ordination into the gö kar chang ##AT##-##AT## lo ’ i dé . Among them were three apprentices of Ngala Rig ’ dzin Dorje , who were the first in his sangha to take these vows .
Two large appliqué thangkas were brought from Austria for the event , one of Yeshé Tsogyel and the one seen here of Padmakara in the form of Guru Nang ##AT##-##AT## srid Zilngön . These appliqué thangkas were made by the sangha of Ngala Rig ’ dzin Dorje on a series of intensive Vajrayana craft retreats , and are a wonderful example of the energy of the Aro gTér tradition in the West .
Gradually over the week of the craft retreat , Ngala Nor ’ dzin directed the process and order of events .
After the lotus petals , the sun and moon were placed .
Then we worked on the khatvangha , making the skulls , flames and tail separately .
Then we assembled Yeshé Tsogyel ’ s robes , face and hat .
Lama Nor ’ dzin was particularly pleased with the attention to detail .
The face of Yeshé Tsogyel had been embroidered in Nepal to Ngak ’ chang Rinpoche ’ s specific design .
However we needed to add lengths of hair to the appliqué .
Sang ##AT##-##AT## gyé plaited ribbon hair extensions and included some strands of hair from Ngak ’ chang Rinpoche and Khandro Déchen , and from Kyabjé Chhi ’ mèd Rig ’ dzin Rinpoche in the plaits .
There was one memorable moment , when everyone thought we had really practically finished the appliqué .
Mmmm … I think we might need to double that braid to get the right effect .
This was towards the end of the last day , and some apprentices – being tired – insisted that the single width looked fine .
However , Ngala Nor ’ dzin was not convinced , and so Naljorma Rin ’ dzin dashed out to her car and sped down to the haberdashers to buy another length before they closed .
On her return a second row of braid was carefully sewn next to the first on the edges of the shawl .
But no – Ngala Nor ’ dzin felt that the blue of the central stripe of the shawl was not quite the right blue and we had to embroider over it with a better colour .
Finally all agreed that these extra efforts did made a substantial difference and added to our experience of finishing the appliqué with a real sense of accomplishment .

This is an hotel for smoking people ( I think like all the hotels in andorra ) .I &apos;ll appreciate a non smoking area the next time .
El hotel nos ha gustado mucho , los salones son muy bonitos y acogedores.La habitación que nos dieron , una doble con balcón y con vistas a las pistas era muy bonita , un poco pequeña pero confortable .

Great hotel with extremely friendly staff !
The high standard of the suit , the calm and no noise and the modern technology of using the paid internet for minuts used rather than counting the time from the first log in .
The staff , the rooms big enough for a family with a young child . The location is also excellent .

I am thinking booking in this hotel again the next time I will be in &quot; Cyprus &quot; .
the service was unfriendly as i have said above ; the breakfast dreadful and unappetising .
completely lack lustre. we wont be back .
The Hotel is basic and the staff helpful and all spoke good English .
Useful location , 5 minute walk to the local fish restaurants , and beach . The Hotel has a smallish swimming pool ( no complaints ) lovely for a quick dip &amp; sun ##AT##-##AT## bathing .
For a short inexpensive stay , I recommend the Cactus , you won &apos;t get the frills of a large Hotel , but who cares , when even breakfast was adequate .
Bring your own shampoo and liquid soap , or buy in the local minimarket .
There wasn &apos;t a minibar in the room which is a must in all hot locations - I suggest that the Hotel up their price to provide a minibar or at least rent ##AT##-##AT## out minibars to guests that want them .
Staff didnt really care about all the things that were wrong with the room . Generally the hotel is run down and the other ones in the area for the same price looked much nicer .

Faults common to many budget hotels in Germany , like : too big and too soft pillows , curtains not so thick to shade morning light , walls so thin you could hear every worker get up and get ready at 7 a.m. ( I think my room was next to somebody &apos;s else toilet ) .
Also : average buffet for those who enjoy continental breakfast , but lousy for latinos like me who just have a croissant or a slice of cake in the morning ( not a single one offered ! ) .
It was very close to messe exchibition , clean and small ##AT##-##AT## frendly .
I was expecting the breakfast to have more choices of sweet staff , or even fresh squeezed juices .
Very helpful and nice staff both at the reception and in the breakfast .
Good breakfast but also some warm items would be nice .. Hotel is well situated .

Other than its location which seems more in an industrial park it was a great hotel .
hotel was booked because of shuttle service - time of required service was confirmed at time of booking but upon arrival , this service was not available .
the reason why most people stay at airport hotels is because of flight times are early morning. there is no point offering this service if it is so limited .
I took the room for the proposed shuttle service but this service only goes to the airport or next train station from 8 am to 5 pm which did not suit me .
Just perfect . Room very large and very clean , wonderful bed , good service , and free internet .

This was a great surprise and I will stay again .
While I expected a relatively small room , I was surprized to find that with a twin booking , we were in a room with two tiny beds , not even normal single width , right up against each other , ie it was in reality a std double bed , with a ridge down the middle .
When booking a twin room I would expect 2 std width single beds , either separate or together .
Blankets on the top of the be were not freshly washed .
The single room was really nice . It was totally new .
When I arrived minibar was not working.They repaired it the next day.TV very small .
Its location is good , very close to main station .

Posizione ottima per visitare la città . Due minuti a piedi per arrivare al Trocadero .
Closeness to the Eiffel Tower and thats about all !
The pictures were not what the hotel presented in true life . The stairs were dangerous , as well as the elevator .
I was overall very displeased and felt I over spent for what they had to offer . We were with a few other people who also rented rooms , we had to argue about everything .
They had us booked longer than we planned , which made the billing inaccurate . They had the wrong type of rooms available for us compared to what we reserved and wwhen I asked questions refering to their actual website and what its amenities were they were unsure of it .
The room was nice , clean , little bit small but enough to stay over night .
Close to Eifel Tower and Arc the Triumpf .
10 min to Eiffel tower on foot . Close to almost any of the historical and shopping places .
Elevator is too small for two people with their baggages . Night watchmen is not so friendly .
Room size , elevator , huge key to be carried around the city !

The hotel staff were very helpful .
Breakfast and room very nice and clean .
Little natural light in the room ( this may not apply to all rooms ) , however this didn &apos;t bother us too much .
Internet should be available everywhere ( guest rooms ) and should be free or at least less expensive . In nowdays , Internet is essential in both work and leisure trips , and paying to access the Internet using small paper cards with passwords is a thing of the 20th century , not acceptable in 2009 .
Old Florence charm with clean , chic decoration which suited the age and style of the building . We had a room which adjoined to one next door with our sons , but still afforded privacy .
Cereals , fruit , ham , cheese and scrambled eggs . Coffee came pre ##AT##-##AT## made in a flask - not what one expects in a hotel of this calibre .
One thing that always buffles me about europe city trips . There are no tea / coffee making facilities in the room .

I would classify this hotel as a business hotel . Not many places to eat around the hotel which makes it difficult w / young kids .
The staff were quite accommodating of the fact that we had a lot of luggage ( we were returning home after 4 year in the Netherland ) .
Shuttle bus service is not like other hotels in schiphol ( 24 / 7 and free of charge ! ) . If you arrive at 1.30 Am and you expect a shuttlebus it is terrible there is no shuttlebus .
ridicolous.Also it costs an extra 20 Euro for a taxi ! ! On the website is written : Holiday Inn Amsterdam Schiphol has a private airport shuttle service .

Sentralt . Moderne rom med det vi trengte .
Tilgang til internett i resepsjon og kaffeautomat . Mindre støy enn forventet for et så sentrumsnært hotell .

Great economy hotel ! Wonderful location , safe and very close to Lisbon &apos;s attractions ; also , many cafes and restaurants nearby , so no need to search for a nice place to eat .
The breakfast was very poor , both regarding quality and quantity .
Location was very close to a lot of things : metro / tram access , restaurants / fast food / pastry shops , shopping areas .
Hotel was clean and lobby was spacious . Breakfast was included and quality of coffee / cocoa / food was good .
Very close to all the sights .
Staff was very helpful when needing information .
Noise coming from halls through the doors .
Breakfast basic ( but acceptable given price ) . Street noise from late night revellers / early deliveries may be an issue for front facing rooms ( though not particularly for me ) .
Overall very convenient and excellent value for money .
The hotel is very well situated , within walking distance of the main attractions , 100 metres from a metro station and near plenty of bars and restaurants . Staff were generally helpful and multilingual .
Breakfast was included , but was so bad that we decided to go somewhere else on the second day . Rooms facing the street can be noisy , and they can feel very small if you are staying more than one or two days ...
The breakfast was quite mediocre but to be fair was included in the excellent price of the room .
The location of the hotel is excellent , on a pedestrianised street , where you can walk straight to the city centre .
The hotel is in a great location , the triple room was very good , we got a good breakfast and all for just over € 30 each per night ! ! great value .
We had a large room our friends a smaller one both were good.Continental breakfast was very good.Recommended.

very nice , very friendly very clean , very cheap ! ! ! !
We got to the hotel around 8am after arriving via the Hotel Train from Madrid and were graciously able to check in early since the room was free . It was a life ##AT##-##AT## saver to be able to catch a little more sleep and take a shower .
Not for our use , but I will note the hotel is up a few flight of stairs with no elevator-- fine for us but could be difficult for others .
Hot water did last very long at all - not even 5 minutes .
The staff were very friendly &amp; helpful . It was also located in the heart of the city .
The stuff is actually not very friendly and not professional . We didn &apos;t feel welcomed there .
The rooms and bed covers could have been cleaner .
Everything - small rooms , terrible and small beds , poor shared bathroom facilities , and very simple , small things that could be easily fixed but that were missing such as shower heads , faucets , and more .
Location of hotel , it was in city center .
The Hotel is really in the centre of Lisbon and its easy to find and quite nice place to stay there for a few days .
The rooms don &apos;t have any heating systems .
Plus our room had a broken window unable to close .
Lack of heating can be a serious problem if not uncomfortable if stayed during the wintertime .
I wouldn &apos;t recommend it as there are a number of nice hostels providing same facilities for similar prices ...
Very well located . Nice and helpful staff .

You don &apos;t need to be in Budapest long to realise that you never know quite where you stand – and that &apos;s not because of the street layout .
Everywhere you look , there is evidence of a city that has been brought to its knees – and restored to its former glory – time and time again .
Even today , it is littered with Roman remains , Turkish baths and Gothic and Baroque architecture , as well as elaborate secessionist ( Hungary ’ s take on Art Nouveau ) facades .
But visiting Budapest is not just about discovering the past , it is also an opportunity to witness a city building its own bright future .
Then it &apos;s on to the real sightseeing .
Must ##AT##-##AT## see landmarks include Europe &apos;s largest Synagogue , the Szent István Basilica and the Buda Royal Palace – not to mention the Széchenyi Lánchíd ( Chain Bridge ) and the dramatic statue of St Gellért , perched above Erzsébet híd ( Elizabeth Bridge ) .
The long walk down the majestic Andrássy út ends at Hősök tere ( Heroes &apos; Square ) , an extravagant monument to Hungary &apos;s key historical figures , and Városliget ( City Park ) , which boasts a host of attractions of its own .
Budapest is not just a city of stunning buildings – many of its museums serve to highlight a history that is proud and unfortunate in equal measure .
The imposing National Museum is impossible to miss , and the chilling House of Terror – the building used by both the Nazi and Communist secret police – is impossible to ignore .
The city is also packed with clubs , concert venues and festivals for music of every possible genre – For 28 years now the Budapest Spring Festival has been Hungary &apos;s biggest cultural festival .
The series of events is of international significance , too .
It is noted in all countries ; travel agencies receive the planned programme months in advance .
In the last two weeks of March around 200 events await Hungarian and foreign tourists in 50 ##AT##-##AT## 60 venues in Budapest .
Besides classical and pop music concerts , there are theatre performances , film screenings , open ##AT##-##AT## air programmes and other festival ##AT##-##AT## type events .
And not far from the traffic and noise of downtown Pest , Margitsziget ( Margaret Island ) is a hub for outdoor activities , and the tranquil hills of Buda are a haven for cyclists , walkers and families .
And who could forget the relaxing and healing properties of the city &apos;s spas .
We are available from monday to saturday from 8.30 until 23.00 on + 31 ( 0 ) 38 ##AT##-##AT## 333 01 01 .

A variation on popular games Acey ##AT##-##AT## Deucey and In ##AT##-##AT## Between , the premise of Red Dog is simple .
The dealer first places two cards from a deck of 52 face ##AT##-##AT## up on the table .
The player must guess whether the value of a randomly selected third card will fall between the values of these two cards .
The narrower the spread between the cards , the more the hand pays !
The value of any card from 2 to 10 counts at face value , a jack counts as 11 , a queen as 12 , a king as 13 , and an ace counts as 14 .
To begin a game , first decide on the table ’ s limits .
These can be found in the drop ##AT##-##AT## down menu beside the Table Games menu . Choose your limit size .
Before the first cards are dealt , you must place an initial wager by choosing and clicking on the desired amount .
Once you &apos;ve placed the amount , press the &quot; Deal &quot; button to see the first two cards .
A marker will be placed on the table to indicate the spread between the two cards , and the corresponding possible payout of the hand .
If a non ##AT##-##AT## consecutive hand has been dealt , you will have the option to &quot; Raise &quot; and double your wager , or just &quot; Stand &quot; and see a third card dealt with no bet increase .
When the dealer draws two cards of the same value , it is known as a “ Pair Hand . ” When this happens , the dealer will automatically draw a third card .
If the third card is the same as the first two , the payout is eleven times your wager .
If the third card does not match , the hand is a tie and your original wager is returned .
If the value of the two cards drawn by the dealer are consecutive ( for example : a 10 and a Jack ) this is called a &quot; Consecutive Hand &quot; .
In this case , the dealer will not draw a third card , the hand is declared a tie and your original wager is returned .
Payouts in Red Dog are based on the probability of the third card falling between the initial two .

Welcome to the Homepage of the German ##AT##-##AT## Danish Cross ##AT##-##AT## Border Air Rescue project .
This pilot project is the first cross ##AT##-##AT## border cooperative initiative between Germany and Denmark in the field of airborne rescue .
Its aim is to establish an economically workable and long ##AT##-##AT## lasting air rescue service in the German ##AT##-##AT## Danish border region .
The German ##AT##-##AT## Danish Cross ##AT##-##AT## Border Air Rescue Service is a reliable and fast emergency resource for citizens on both sides of the border .
In Denmark this is the first time that an air rescue service of this kind has become available .
The main partners in the project are : on the German side , the DRF Air Rescue and the administrative district Nordfriesland , and on the Danish side , the rescue service operator FALCK and the region Syddanmark ( until 2006 : administrative district Sønderjyllands amt ) .
In addition there are other partners from the areas of health services and politics .
within the INTERREG III A Sønderjylland ##AT##-##AT## Schleswig programme .
The project &quot; cross ##AT##-##AT## border air rescue &quot; ended in June 2008 after three years of working time . The project steering committee summarised experiences , results and perspectives in a Danish ##AT##-##AT## German final report .
Pictures and interviews of partners make the brochure comprehensible and easy to read – for professionals and everyone who is interested .

Siwa Oasis - &quot; Ammon / Hammon &quot; in Classical antiquity - is situated on the far side of Egypt &apos;s &quot; Western Desert &quot; , some 80km from the border with Libya and 300km south of Marsa Matruh on the Mediterranean coast .
Extending an average of 17m below sea level the depression is characterized by large expanses of water and &quot; Inselbergs &quot; .
One of the latter ( Qarat A. , with spring ) carries the acropolis and the Temple of the Oracle , while a &quot; contra temple &quot; ( UB .
) is situated on a low rise amongst the palm groves below , some 400m further south .
It is not before the Eg . Late Period ( Amasis , 570 ##AT##-##AT## 525 BC ) that Siwa emerges from historical obscurity , called Santar , a Libyco ##AT##-##AT## Eg .
Famous throughout the Mediterranean world on account of its Eg.-style oracle and the visit Alexander the Great had paid to god Amun , Siwa goes unmentioned in sources from the Nile valley . Till Roman times the oasis remained a sovereign &quot; sheikh ##AT##-##AT## dom &quot; ruled by a Libyan tribal chief ( &quot; basileus &quot; ) .
Cultural ties to neighboring Egypt probably existed long before the 26 .
Dyn . , yet &quot; business wise &quot; ( promoting Siwa as a place of pilgrimage and desert trade ) the oasis shared common interests with Greeks .
During the 1st cent . AD , finally , the &quot; nomus hammoniacus &quot; became part of Roman Egypt .
In Byzantine times it belonged to the dioceses of the Libyan eparchy . Known to the Arabs by its indigenous Name ( Santariya ) , the oasis first ( 708 BC ) swatted all attempts to conquer it .
Not until the middle of the 12th cent. did Islam gain a foot ##AT##-##AT## hold there .
In 1792 W. H. Browne &quot; rediscovered &quot; the oasis initiating a flurry of visits on the part of European travelers as well as scholarly fascination with the ancient oracle that lasted for a century .
Drawings and maps of archaeological value , however , are limited to the temple of UB . , then in a much better state of preservation and the only site accessible .
In 1900 the Egyptologist G. Steindorff was the first to record the relief &apos;s and texts and to establish as fact that the ruins on A. were those of the famous Temple of the Oracle .
To him and the architects H. Ricke and H. Aubin we owe the first historic and architectural details emerging from in situ . Subsequently , it was the Eg .
archaeologist A. Fakhry who greatly improved upon our knowledge of the site and who in the early 1970s had the Temple of the Oracle cleared of surrounding and intrusive dwellings .
At the beginning of the project a general topographic map of the archaeological site was drawn up as well as a map showing the geological stratigraphy of the temple mound . Excavations centered first on UB . , later moved towards the &quot; dromos &quot; -area between this temple and A.
Clearance work in the Temple of the Oracle dealt with the remains of modern debris and intrusive buildings until reaching the bedrock . The building has seen a detailed recording of its architectural features and of the distribution of stone material traced to different quarries as well as charting an assessment of damages ( erosion , salt ) .
to keep the building from falling off the cliff - reversible temporary emergency measures were introduced initially comprised of steel supports . Meanwhile , the latter have been replaced as much as possible by moderate , unobtrusive invasive steps permanently securing the endangered parts of the monument and bedrock .
Currently , preparations are under way to excavate ( 1 .
) the ( hypothetical ) palace area bordering the Temple of the Oracle to the west , ( 2 . ) the underground passage serving the palace &apos;s need for water from the nearby holy well ( Diodorus ) and ( 3 .
) the depression extending in ##AT##-##AT## between the well and the former pylon of the temple &apos;s fore ##AT##-##AT## court .
A feasibility study concerning the extension of stabilizing measures to other areas of the temp ##AT##-##AT## le mound is ready for submission to the Supreme Council of Antiquities . If finance can be secured the project could go ahead immediately .
The site map was produced photogrammetrically based on aerial photographs obtained from a hot ##AT##-##AT## air balloon ( Zeppelin ) .
Photogrammetry was also used for obtaining elevations of most of the walls of the Temple of the Oracle . All plans underwent correction by hand and were then digitized .
Excavations were surveyed using a total station ( computerized theodolite ) for generating plans , which were again manually corrected , digitized and finished in AutoCAD .
Measures directed towards strengthening and preserving the bedrock and temple walls on A. centered on the insertion of pre ##AT##-##AT## tensed rock- and intra mural ##AT##-##AT## anchors .
Pertinent studies ( stress engineering , geology , mineralogy ) served as scientific basis for the work .
Mineral materials employed in restoration were chosen in accordance with ancient building materials .
Technical details derived from the study of the masonry of the Temple of the Oracle ( opus pseudo ##AT##-##AT## isdomomum , claw ##AT##-##AT## chisel marks , type of anathyrosis , lewis holes ) reveal unequivocally that the Ammonians employed Greek rather than Egyptian builders . Surprisingly , however , joints and the rubble filling of stretcher courses are cemented together using a liquid mortar of anhydrite ( gypsum ) , thus achieving extraordinary sturdiness in conjunction with the walls &apos; bedrock foundations .
Therefore , partitioning walls have been tied into lateral walls only here and there at unspecific courses , trusting that regular bonding could be avoided . The basic plan ( forecourt &gt; ( pseudo- ) pronaos &gt; two halls &gt; holy of holies ) , architectural sculpturing ( fluted columns , cavetto cornice , torus ) as well as the decoration of the temple ( figures of Eg .
example . Concerning the &quot; secret chamber &quot; above the holy of holies accessible only from the roof by means of a ladder in a concealed corridor , the arrangement appears to meet the requirements of oracles proceeding behind closed doors as they were originally devised for the Eg .
At the foot of the acropolis and in direct line with its gate a stretch of ashlar masonry has been excavated that aims straight for UB . A bit further to the south , excavations yielded the remains of the ( ashlar ) foundations of another building , inscribed with Greek mason marks and positioned at right angles to the hypothetical dromos .
Registry Trash Keys Finder ( TrashReg ) is an advanced Registry cleaning tool .
The main function of RTKF is to allow the removal of unnecessary keys from the Windows Registry .
Many programs leave keys in the Registry , even after programs removal using an uninstallation facility provided with the programs themselves .
RTKF allows you to decide whether to delete or leave the keys found .
An additional effect ( it may be the main aim for some users ) of removal of these keys is the &quot; revival &quot; of some programs trial versions after the initial trial period has expired .
The oldest review of TrashReg was made by Softoogle editors a couple years ago .
You can find this review here .
Registry Trash Keys Finder requires a PC running Windows 95 / 98 / ME / 2000 / XP / 2003 / Vista .

Actually there are two different versions of Registry Trash Keys Finder .
The first one is the Freeware version that can be freely downloaded from my website or from other software download sites .
The second one is the Full version .
There are a few important additional searches not fully implemented in the Freeware version .
Full version is not available for free downloading and at the moment it requires making a personal contribution for TrashReg project further development .
By some signs the Full version of Registry Trash Keys Finder can be likened to DonationWare software .
DonationWare is software where you give to the author what you think his software is worth .
The author gives you a few suggestions of what , he humbly thinks , deserves for further development of his program but you have the final word , absolutely .
I must admit that I sometimes wonder why I &apos;m spending hours adding more features to RTKF .
Or why I &apos;m translating every version into English .
There are several reasons , and money is one of them .
I have expenses for developing and distributing RTKF : backup CD ##AT##-##AT## ROM &apos;s , domain name , expensive internet access , ink , paper , bread and butter , coffee and a lot of Russian Vodka ( of course it &apos;s a joke : - ) ) ...

In the course of the controversy over the Danish caricatures , the grand imam of the influential Al ##AT##-##AT## Azhar ##AT##-##AT## University in Cairo suggested a worldwide ban on the injury of religious sensibilities .
This was to be based on a law drafted by leading representatives of the religions of the world , including himself and Pope Benedict XVI .
This bizarre suggestion acts like a concentrate of the contemporary situation .
Alone the idea that religious leaders could draft a legal text is like an echo from long ##AT##-##AT## gone theocracies .
Also interesting is the ecumenical approach , which clearly does not anticipate inter ##AT##-##AT## religious offence , but only that caused by secularized individuals .
However , most bizarre is the way the imam &apos;s seemingly anachronistic suggestion , in its complete misconception of the Western world , unintentionally reveals a truth about our present – a truth that , paradoxically , also feeds the fundamental misunderstandings of the current debate .
In order to approach this complex state of affairs , we should first of all bear in mind the incredible revival the concept of religious sensibility has undergone since the start of the cartoon controversy .
Unnoticed , it has taken centre stage in the public sphere .
The reception it has enjoyed there is all the more remarkable for the fact that this public has constituted itself precisely through the elimination of all subjectivities .
The Italian philosopher Paolo Flores d &apos;Arcais has dealt with this development in a recent text .
In it , he shows religious sensibility in its role as opponent of freedom : my freedom should not end where your sensibility begins , he writes .
However , the latter manages to gain entry – through the back door as it were – as a caveat that infiltrates the individual , whose ethics of responsibility it mobilizes , thereby developing its effect as self ##AT##-##AT## censor , as a kind of super ##AT##-##AT## ego , that forbids itself any action that could be interpreted as provocation .
D &apos;Arcais clearly rejects the aspirations of religious sensibility to a position in the public sphere .
According to him , this is because faith is not an absolute in the public sphere , since in democracy the latter is &quot; inviolably pluralistic &quot; .
As much as d &apos;Arcais is to be agreed with in an ethical sense , it must be said that this attitude – which could be called the Western attitude # 1 – is insufficient .
The complexity of the contemporary situation consists among other things in it not being enough simply to adopt a stance .
In doing so , d &apos;Arcais &apos;s analysis overlooks an essential political change .
The delimitation that underlies his argumentation between the public sphere and privacy within a civil society underwent a major alteration a long time ago .
As opposed to the former premise , according to which one had to get rid of one &apos;s particularities in order to enter the public sphere , this step is now taken precisely in the name of private identity .
One receives public attention precisely on account of one &apos;s singularity , as such becoming part of the social whole : as woman , as homosexual , and now as someone with religious sensibilities .
As the French theorist of democracy Marcel Gauchet concludes , civil society is &quot; going public &quot; , while the state is &quot; going private &quot; .
The imam unintentionally illustrated this change .
This has major effects upon the public discourse of our societies .
In this way specific demands are no longer hedged in a political language – for example , they are no longer formulated into a programme .
It is rather a matter of influencing the political by means of an unequivocally apolitical language , a &quot; language of ethical demands &quot; ( Gauchet ) .
Thus the public sphere becomes increasingly substantialized : it is confronted with values supposed to govern it .
As if under a magnifying glass , it is exactly this development that can be observed in the cartoon controversy .
The person with religious sensibilities has not formulated his demand for recognition in a political language , calling for example for an improvement in the situation for migrants .
It is much more that he or she has &quot; gone public &quot; in their religious feelings and sought confirmation as such .
&#91; 1 &#93; One must therefore see that this discourse , which d &apos;Arcais so decisively opposes , could only &quot; take hold &quot; because it met with a disposition of our changed public space , one that promotes such positions .
The cartoon controversy fell on fertile ground .
For the Western attitude # 1 , then , it becomes apparent that it is no longer sufficient to combat this discourse with the long ##AT##-##AT## since invalid concept of a public sphere .
However now there is another Western attitude # 2 , one of understanding for the Islamic world .
Here , however , the attitude is based on mistaken recognition .
Its understanding is based on a fundamental misunderstanding .
This becomes obvious when one asks oneself whether or not these phenomena , which occupy the public worldwide , is now a &quot; clash of civilizations &quot; .
This question is all the more difficult to answer , when even talking about such a clash can be anti ##AT##-##AT## Islamic .
However that would only be the case if one understood by &quot; civilizations &quot; what the originator of this slogan , Samuel Huntington , has – quite rightly – been accused of : the idea that these are fixed cultural units , monolithic blocs , that &quot; naturally &quot; come into conflict with one another .
And the related conviction that the division of the world according to cultural characteristics ( however these may be defined ) necessarily means a hierarchization – in this case , the bolstering of a Western , American dominance , one that is to be defended .
In this sense , the term &quot; clash of civilizations &quot; would in fact be a declaration of war , not an analysis .
Nevertheless , one shouldn &apos;t lay aside this formulation quite so soon if one wants to understand what is going on at the moment .
Thomas Asshauer has written in Die Zeit – in a polemic against Huntington – that religion is &quot; often only a mask &#91; ... &#93; behind which are hidden brutal conflicts of recognition and defence &quot; .
However that seems to be exactly where a fundamental misunderstanding arises .
The idea that religion is merely an irrational mask for an underlying rationality means not to take religion seriously .
It recalls the characterization of religion as a &quot; superstructural phenomenon &quot; that must lead back to its real basis .
In reducing Islam like this , one passes up the chance of understanding the specific function that it has today .
This is no mask behind which to hide other truths such as poverty , exploitation , or lack of opportunities : rather – and precisely because of these problems – it is far more the field in which identity is generated .
An identity that no longer restricts itself to national borders , but that answers to a transnational , pan ##AT##-##AT## Islamic call , that Muslims from Turkey to Pakistan can follow .
The importance of this function of religious belief becomes clear if one bears in mind the following : of course all these conflicts really exist – however , despite their overbearing reality , they are not carried over into social or economic conflicts .
The field in which they are played out and &quot; fought over &quot; is religion or culture .
Not only is that something different than a mask , it is its opposite .
Religion can take on this function only when its meaning is fundamentally altered .
Here , it is not religion in the sense of piety or holy experience that is being contemporized .
The appeal to religion becomes something polemic , something that is set against others , in order to challenge an equally imaginary Other – the West .
Therefore , the oft ##AT##-##AT## discussed question of how far Muslims are united in their faith , or which schisms , as indices of a rational distance , might exist , is ultimately irrelevant .
Because here religion no longer functions primarily as a reference to a transcendence , but as the generation of community , an identity in other words , that is directed against something .
It becomes a field on which the losers of globalization can unite .
It is precisely this shift that is overlooked by the Western attitude # 2 that believes it recognizes its liberal , privatist understanding of religion in the cartoon controversy .
But the conflict , with its understandable but also with its disproportionate reactions , has shown that the demand for respect for religious conviction turns into its opposite , and that religion – which is precisely not privatized – can become a means to challenge the liberal West .
The sacred becomes a banner under which Muslims worldwide can unite against the West .
In this sense , one is obliged to say that Huntington is right , religion is the ideological form in which conflicts with the West are fought .
So Huntington is then right if one understands &quot; clash of civilizations &quot; as the &quot; clash of cultural ideologies &quot; .
Of course , culturizing the conflict in this way is playing with fire .
But those who warn of this fail to recognize that such a process has already occurred .
The character of the conflict has long since shifted from a secular , social ##AT##-##AT## economic level to a religious , fundamentalist one .
This shift is synonymous with the change from rational conflicts , which ultimately appear to be quantifiable , and therefore divisible and solvable , to cultural ##AT##-##AT## loading , which turns these into identitarian conflicts .
What we are witnessing is not an irrational masking of rational problems , but far more that the conflict itself has become irrational .
The reason for this is what could be called &quot; terrorist totalitarianism &quot; .
Not only has terrorism dissociated the terrain of battle from every rational and negotiable level .
It has also brought about an unbelievable extension of the conflict , whereby it not only involves in the cultural ##AT##-##AT## religious conflict those who want such a thing , but also draws in those who do not .
It compels moderates to identify themselves as Muslims , and thus – whether intentionally or not – to join its ranks .
The differentiation between radicals and moderates thus becomes increasingly loose .
More and more sectors of the population are brought in – as the cartoon conflict has been exemplary in showing .
Where exactly do the boundaries between Islam and Islamism , which all liberals evoke , run ?
Terrorist totalitarianism also explains why the much invoked &quot; dialogue &quot; of cultures does not help , since this sets liberalism as a prerequisite not only for the interlocutor , but for the field in which such a dialogue may occur in the first place .
With religious identity , however , Islamism has from the start placed itself on another terrain : it has not only made religion the stake of the conflict , it has also made it the medium through which that conflict is waged .
However here lies the crux of the Western attitude # 1 , which , when answering the central question in this conflict of which is more important to us , the values of the Enlightenment or those of religion , opts unequivocally for the former .
Because it fails to recognize that this question rests on false grounds : it allows in answer only a declaration of faith – regardless of which of the two alternatives one opts for .
However , the moment the so ##AT##-##AT## called &quot; West &quot; treats democracy – which is in fact a specific form of a faithless faith – like a faith , when it begins to defend its order as if it were an article of faith , it has followed its opponent onto his own side of the net : into the irrationality of a battle of faith .
This totalitarian game can &apos;t be won – it can only be rejected .

&#91; 1 &#93; The imam &apos;s demand for a legal stipulation – which is indeed indebted to the rubric &quot; theocracy &quot; – would catch up with him , however : the legal protection of the individual believer in his or her subjective feelings would result in his flock breaking up into individuals .
The Roman orator Cicero wrote that &quot; not to know history is to be always a child &quot; . But are those who know history necessarily more grown ##AT##-##AT## up ?
Cicero doesn &apos;t say . In truth , very few of us , if any , use history to guide our decisions .
The more recent and pressing such experience is , the more zealous our courses of action . For the vast majority , history and its lessons fall by the wayside .
Another problem with direct experience is the fact that it is non ##AT##-##AT## transferable .
The experience of others can be at most a mirror we hold up to our own experience to broaden our perspective .
This concerns the experience of Iraq as well as that of Germany .
At most one can copy this model or that model , something which , in the case of Iraq , has its own story .
In the mid ##AT##-##AT## 1930s , several Arab nationalists developed a political programme whose goal was to fulfil the &quot; eternal mission &quot; of &quot; unity , freedom , and socialism &quot; . As formulated by the chief ideologue of the Baath party , Michel Aflaq , unity was the natural law , the moral and historical necessity that all Arabs live in a single nation state .
To lend support to their concept , Arab nationalists drew on Johann Gottfried von Herder &apos;s statements about the mind and body of a nation . The mind of the Arab nation is Islam , and its body is Pan Arabism , both coming together to produce continuous revolution .
How this mind and body were ultimately put into practice in Iraq is shown by the nationalist coup led by Rashid &apos; Ali al ##AT##-##AT## Qilani in May 1941 .
Supported militarily by the Nazis , the coup resulted in a nationalist mob storming the Jewish quarters of Baghdad and killing dozens of Jewish citizens – a wild pogrom patterned after the 1938 Reichskristallnacht , the &quot; Night of Broken Glass &quot; .
This tragic event was subsequently known in modern Iraqi history by the notorious term Farhud al ##AT##-##AT## Yahud , the looting of the Jews .
The pogrom brutally demonstrated the close ties between Nazi Germany and Arab Nationalists . From the meeting between Amin al ##AT##-##AT## Hussaini , the Grand Mufti of Jerusalem , and Adolf Hitler to the ultra ##AT##-##AT## national regime of Saddam Hussein , one sees repeated examples of a German ##AT##-##AT## Arab pact .
However much the nationalist systems in Germany and Iraq differed due to societal structures , they were perfectly identical in their battle against political heterogeneity . Each imposed a Gleichschaltung leading to ethnic and religious persecution of minorities , the dissolution of leftwing parties and liberal forces , rigid cultural control , the militarization of society , and , in the end , wars of extermination .
Yet compared with Germany &apos;s impressive postwar development , the situation in Iraq post Saddam Hussein seems bleak .
Iraq is a country rich in history and culture , a country that continuously sought and found new forms of expression , a country that laid the basic principles of the Western and Eastern worlds .
It was the country of trade that invented the written language ; it was the country where poetry , storytelling , numbers , mathematics , astronomy , medicine , art , music , laws , and myth began ; it was the origin of religious scripture , the cradle of the prophet . But despite these material and intellectual riches , Iraq has become a country of chronic suffering .
Its people lack basic resources ; massive human rights violations and matchless repressions abound ; armed conflict , sanctions , looting , and environmental destruction are the order of the day ; its people have been traumatized through terror , forced into flight , and killed in senseless static warfare . Though Iraq can boast of a great diversity of identities and languages , it has remained a place of bloody ethnic and nationalist confrontation .
For all of its modern troubles , however , Iraq has had its own experiences with democracy . And as it happens , these experiences occurred at nearly the same time as Germany &apos;s first attempts to establish a democracy , during the Weimar Republic .
On 11 March 1917 , the British army , under the command of General Frederick Maude , marched into Baghdad and cleared out the remaining Ottoman garrisons , thus ending four centuries of rule in the name of Islam . After Turkey &apos;s capitulation in 1918 , the British declared that a freely elected national government in Iraq was one of its objectives .
Though General Maude announced emphatically that he had come to liberate , not to conquer , most Iraqis remained sceptical . The British colonialists attempted to garner support from those Iraqi groups that were willing to cooperate , promising them high positions in the military administration .
But the rural populations and the religious clergy were not persuaded by these conciliatory offerings and adamantly rejected the occupation .
Their bitter resistance to the British army culminated in the major revolt of 1920 , which led the British to appoint an Arab king , create a provisional parliament , and hold general elections . The coronation of Faisal I on 23 August 1921 – in which the British played a decisive role – marked the start of democratization in Iraq .
Faisal was received enthusiastically by the people of Baghdad and the Iraqi elite , and the British regarded it as a veritable coup . But very quickly a strange political constellation emerged .
On the one hand were idealistic British government officials interested in questions of human rights ; on the other hand were corrupt colonial administrators in cahoots with similarly corrupt Iraqis . The gradually disillusioned Iraqi political elite decided to give their support to the latter .
The fact there was corruption ought not to overshadow the achievements of the time .
The British occupation brought with it major changes in people &apos;s lives as well as a new set of economic , social , and political values .
One of the greatest accomplishments was the abolishment of the veil , brought about by noted politicians and intellectuals , as well as ( most importantly ) women themselves .
Also during this time , the first parties , unions , and associations were established ; Iraqi literature , the so ##AT##-##AT## called New Classicism , reached its high point ; and music , theatre , and visual arts experienced an impressive renaissance after a long period of prohibition under Ottoman rule .
It was widely feared that Britain would not make good on its promise to grant Iraq its independence . Many suspected that former Iraqi officers close to King Faisal and on friendly terms with the Mandate forces were receiving preferential treatment so as to secure treaties and contracts favourable to the British .
Four years later , King Faisal , the founder of modern Iraq , died and was succeeded by his twenty ##AT##-##AT## one ##AT##-##AT## year ##AT##-##AT## old son , Gazi . Consumed by a deep hatred toward the British – they had betrayed his grandfather Scharif Hussain of Mekka and had disappointed his own father , Faisal – Gazi lacked a clear political vision , and the situation in Iraq under his rule became increasingly instable .
In 1936 , the Chief of Staff of the Iraqi army , Bakr Sudqi – a person already notorious for his brutal military campaigns against the Assyrians in the North and the Arab tribes in the South – responded with a coup d &apos;etat . Three years later , the young King Gazi was killed in a car accident , and the Iraqis immediately blamed the English for his murder .
Thinking that these developments could threaten their own interests , the British pressured their Iraqi allies to renew the Treaty of 1930 , the Anglo ##AT##-##AT## Iraqi agreement that provided supposed independence for the Iraqis . The new treaty , signed in Portsmouth in 1948 , triggered a large protest , which the British violently put down .
Instead of carefully establishing democratic measures , the powers that be in Iraq did the exact opposite : parliament was suspended , opposition parties were outlawed , their papers banned , and martial law was imposed .
In this climate , volatile military officers , including Abdul Karim Qassim and Abdul Salam Muhammad Arif , became national heroes . On 14 July 1958 , these free officers seized power , expelled the British army , and deposed the monarchy .
Nearly the entire family of the king was executed in their Palace of Roses and the most powerful ally of the British , Nuri as ##AT##-##AT## Said , was dragged through the streets of Baghdad , after which his body was dismembered and set on fire .
As a whole , it is correct to claim that democracy is a decisive and necessary form of government for a developed industrial society . Democracy can find a basis consensus among the antagonistic and diverse interests of varying groups , peacefully resolving conflicts and promoting society &apos;s continued development .
The problem has to do with the absence of democratic cornerstones . Countries such as Bangladesh , Indonesia , or Pakistan – places where even secular women have held power – are in great danger due to the enormous economic problems faced by their ancient and nomadic societies .
A decisive factor for practicing democracy is the degree to which a nation is organized or can be organized . Without firm organization , no decisions or checks can be carried out .
&quot; Umar , the Islamic Caliph , will now destroy me &quot; , Rustan is reported to have said , &quot; for he is teaching the dogs how to behave . &quot; Today , of course , this organizational potential is not being utilized for technical revolutions , but for brutal Islamic terror .
The most important components of a democracy – the constitutional state , free elections , and freedom of the press – remained empty ideas in Iraq . Although Iraq never lacked proponents of democracy , the anti ##AT##-##AT## democratic forces were always a step ahead .
With organized opposition weak and plagued by in ##AT##-##AT## fighting , its members could easily be side ##AT##-##AT## stepped , intimidated , exiled , or , as in the case of communist leaders in 1949 , executed without trial .
A decisive point ignored in most discussions of Iraq is the absence of the concept of &quot; citizen &quot; . In Iraq , the citizen was replaced by the subject on whom the will of the state imposed itself .
Everything that the state gave was a mere donation ; everything that the state took was its fair toll .
And what about the new wave of democracy in Iraq today ? It hardly needs to be said that the current situation in Iraq is enormously depressing .
For the prevailing model in Iraq is not democratic at all , but absolutely anti ##AT##-##AT## democratic , with its lining of orthodox religion from both the Shiite and Sunni camps dividing power nearly perfectly along confessional lines .
It does not suffice to replace Saddam &apos;s state by one less bad and less corrupt . One needs to do significantly more to take into account the interests of the Iraqi population , to establish a basis from which the legacy of Saddam Hussein &apos;s regime – the confessional and ethnic rifts between Sunni and Shiite , Arab and Kurd – can be overcome .
Though Saddam is no longer in power , his legacy will continue to cast a long shadow , for he systematically destroyed everything on whose basis a democratic Iraq could be built . Iraqis do not have the strength – in case they have any left at all – to rebuild their country .
More urgently than ever , they need massive support from Western democracies in every area of life : safeguarding the national borders , building infrastructure , fighting terror , reducing unemployment , finding internal answers to the nationality question . In addition , the country needs a competent , experienced government to carry out the reconstruction and a diplomatic control apparatus to oversee its implementation .
It needs a basic framework for the organized return of Iraqi exiles and refuges .
It needs general amnesty for all those in Saddam &apos;s regime who did not grossly violate human rights or commit war crimes . And , finally , it is imperative that the idea of a confederation be considered that has Shiite support .
Fortunately , some of these demands have been adopted by Iraqi political parties and included in the new constitution , but Iraq will not become a model of democracy for the Arab and Islamic world overnight . ( It took forty years for the Federal Republic of Germany to convince the East Germans to follow suit .
The debate about prostitution is conducted between two poles .
Abolitionists hold that prostitution exploits women per se and call for the prosecution of the pimps and even customers as a measure against sex slavery and trafficking in human beings .
Liberals hold that sex is a commodity like any other and call for the social recognition and official regulation of prostitution in order to improve prostitutes &apos; working conditions .
Both positions are simplifications , writes Julia O &apos;Connell Davidson .
Any policy genuinely aiming at improving the lives of migrant sex workers must focus on reducing poverty in the countries of origin .
Both feminist and religiously inspired abolitionists have long viewed , and continue to view , male demand for commercial sex as a root cause of prostitution and the abuses that can accompany it ( child sexual exploitation , violence , &quot; trafficking &quot; , abusive and slavery ##AT##-##AT## like employment practices ) .
Until recently , calls to criminalise and reform men who buy sex have often fallen on deaf ears .
Now suddenly , it seems that policy makers are beginning to listen .
Over the past decade , &quot; John Schools &quot; to re ##AT##-##AT## educate men caught kerb ##AT##-##AT## crawling have sprung up in the United States , Canada and the UK .
In 1998 , Sweden introduced legislation that criminalizes the buying of sex .
More particularly , growing international concern about the phenomena of &quot; human trafficking &quot; has encouraged a shift in attitudes and policy responses towards prostitution .
Here too , there is increasing receptivity to the idea that those who consume commercial sex may represent a social problem , for it is frequently asserted that it is the demand for young and foreign prostitutes that makes trafficking into a profitable activity .
So , for example , the Swedish Ombudsman for gender equality , Claes Borgström , called for a boycott of the World Cup in Germany on grounds that it would stimulate demand for prostitution , and therefore lead to an increase in trafficking and sexual slavery ; while the UN Special Rapporteur , Sigma Huda , remarked in her latest report that ³ regular ² prostitution falls within the category of trafficking , and stated that the most efficient means to reduce the demand for trafficking is to criminalize the purchase of sexual services .
More generally , in international policy circles , it is increasingly common to hear talk of the need to address &quot; the demand ##AT##-##AT## side of trafficking &quot; , and a number of research studies on this phenomenon have recently been commissioned .
Though the idea that &quot; sex trafficking &quot; is stimulated by the demand for commercial sexual services has a certain commonsense appeal , this paper argues that questions about the relationship between exploitative and abusive labour practices in the sex sector and the demand for commercial sexual services are rather more complicated than is allowed in dominant anti ##AT##-##AT## trafficking discourse .
What is the demand side of &quot; sex trafficking &quot; ?
Until recently , there was no international agreement as to the proper legal definition of the term &quot; trafficking &quot; .
Following much debate between those with a political stake in the issue , in November 2000 , the UN Convention Against Transnational Organised Crime was adopted by the UN General Assembly , and with it two new protocols , one on smuggling of migrants and one on trafficking in persons – the Protocol to Prevent , Suppress and Punish Trafficking in Persons , Especially Women and Children .
The recruitment , transportation , transfer , harbouring or receipt of persons , by means of the threat or use of force or other forms of coercion , of abduction , of fraud , of deception , of the abuse of power or of a position of vulnerability or of the giving or receiving of payments or benefits to achieve the consent of a person having control over another person , for the purpose of exploitation .
The Trafficking Protocol entered into force in December 2003 .
By 2004 , it had been signed by 117 countries and it is often assumed to have successfully laid the definitional problems and political divisions associated with the term &quot; trafficking &quot; to rest .
Critics point out that , framed within the Convention on Transnational Organised Crime , and packaged with a Protocol on smuggling , the Trafficking Protocol reflects a preoccupation with &quot; illegal immigration &quot; as part and parcel of a supposed security threat posed by transnational organised crime as opposed to a concern with the human rights of migrants .
&#91; 2 &#93; Furthermore , though it provides a definition of &quot; trafficking &quot; , the protocol leaves undefined many of the constituent elements of what is described as &quot; trafficking &quot; .
So , for example , the terms &quot; sexual exploitation &quot; and &quot; exploitation of the prostitution of others &quot; are not defined .
From one political perspective – which can loosely be termed &quot; abolitionist &quot; – prostitution represents a form of male sexual violence against women .
A market in commercial sexual services is said to necessarily reduce women and girls to mere objects of trade , and thus no distinction can be made between &quot; forced &quot; and &quot; voluntary &quot; prostitution .
A woman cannot volunteer to be dehumanised through prostitution any more than she could meaningfully consent to sell herself into slavery . Viewed through this particular lens , to employ a woman to work as a prostitute is by definition to &quot; exploit &quot; her , and to pay for commercial sexual services is automatically to commit an act of &quot; sexual exploitation &quot; .
Lobby groups that adopt this political perspective therefore insist that the demand for commercial sexual services acts as a stimulus for trafficking – if there were no market for prostitution there would be no trafficking . They are adamant that States should penalise men who buy sex , as well as third parties who organise and / or financially benefit from prostitution .
Needless to say , this position is unacceptable to those at the other end of the political spectrum .
For those who adopt a liberal or libertarian stance on sex commerce , viewing it as little different in moral and political terms from any other market in personal services , the idea that it is necessary to eradicate the entire commercial sex market in order to address the problem of trafficking for prostitution is as draconian and wrong ##AT##-##AT## headed as the idea that it is necessary to eliminate demand for carpets in order to address the problem of forced and child labour in the carpet industry .
Viewed through this lens , questions about the demand side of &quot; trafficking &quot; for prostitution are clearly questions about employer demand for forced labour rather than consumer demand .
Protagonists on both sides of the &quot; sex slavery or sex work &quot; debate often gloss over challenges to their position posed by the body of empirical evidence on prostitution in the contemporary world .
Third party involvement does not map tidily onto the settings from which prostitutes work , and whether involved in &quot; indoor &quot; or &quot; outdoor &quot; prostitution , prostitutes may be controlled by an extremely abusive third party , or working completely independently , or somewhere between these two extremes .
The degree of direct economic exploitation to which prostitutes are exposed thus spans a continuum from absolute ( as when a third party appropriates all of the money garnered through an individual &apos;s prostitution ) to entirely absent ( as when a person who prostitutes independently keeps all of her or his earnings ) .
The term &quot; prostitution &quot; does not refer to a uniform experience . To describe as &quot; sex slavery &quot; the condition of an adult woman who works independently as an escort partly because it satisfies her own personal interest in anonymous sex and partly because she can earn upwards of 2000 Euros per week from it is clearly unsatisfactory , just as it would be unsatisfactory to describe as a &quot; sex worker &quot; a teenager who has been kidnapped , imprisoned and physically forced to prostitute .
Whether we are talking about sex work or any other form of labour , the line between coercion and consent is not and never has been clear ##AT##-##AT## cut . In the absence of alternative opportunities , or where the inducements are great enough , people can and do volunteer to enter contracts that may harm them or that they would not otherwise choose to enter .
In Europe today , opportunities to buy sexual experience across a market are greater and more varied , commercial sexual experience can be consumed legally as well as illegally , and the boundaries between commercial sex and other forms of consumption ( leisure , tourism , entertainment , etc . ) are more blurred .
Does the expansion of this market fuel &quot; trafficking &quot; ? There is no automatic relationship between consumer demand and any specific form of employment relation in the sex industry .
In theory , demand for any given commercial sexual service can just as well be met by someone working independently in good conditions as by someone subject to abusive and slavery ##AT##-##AT## like practices . And yet there are some fairly obvious reasons to expect that the rapid expansion of a market that is poorly regulated , widely stigmatised and partially criminalized will be associated with an increased incidence of abusive labour practices .
In this sense , growing consumer demand is undoubtedly one of the factors contributing to the phenomenon of forced labour in the sex industry . Though it does not follow that all demand is now met by unfree labour ( indeed , viewed as a whole , it is almost certainly the case that the vast bulk of those working in Europe &apos;s sex sector are formally free wage workers or self ##AT##-##AT## employed individuals ) , I believe this does give us legitimate reasons to feel concern about the expansion of demand for commercial sex .
Demand for commercial sex is , like all forms of consumer demand , very much a socially , culturally and historically determined matter . It is also intimately related to questions about supply , availability , and affordability .
There is no absolute or given level of demand for the services of lap ##AT##-##AT## dancers in any society , for example , and before the relatively recent advent of lap dance clubs , no one bemoaned their absence . However , though supply may be a necessary condition for demand , it is not always a sufficient condition .
Demand must also be socially constructed in the sense that people have to be taught to imagine that they want or need a given product or service . Consumption is , as many sociologists and historians have observed , a form of display both in the sense that it is a marker of identity and social status , and also in the sense that it is used to punctuate time , to ritualistically and publicly mark off our passage through the day , the week , the year , our life .
Human beings are not born wishing to buy commercial sexual services or to visit lap dance clubs , for instance , any more than they are born with specific desires to play the lottery or drink coca ##AT##-##AT## cola .
Markets are socially constructed and historically contingent .
As Spillman puts it , the creation of a market involves &quot; the cultural construction of objects of market exchange , the cultural construction of the parties to market exchange , and the cultural construction of norms of exchange &quot; .
&#91; 5 &#93; This insight is just as relevant in relation to the market for prostitution as it is to any other market .
However , each of the three elements of construction are contested in relation to the prostitution market .
To begin with , the idea that the capacity to bring sexual pleasure to another human being can be treated as an alienable object of market exchange is disputed .
Feminist abolitionists , who view prostitution as a form of male sexual violence akin to rape , vigorously reject the idea that sexual services can be detached from the person and sold across a market without harm to the female prostitute .
But it is not just feminist abolitionists who have trouble imagining sexual services as straightforward objects of market exchange , and prostitutes as market actors like any other .
Although prostitution is popularly understood to be a market ( indeed , it is commonly naturalised as such – people speak of it as &quot; the world &apos;s oldest profession &quot; , and say that it is inevitable ) , most people remain either ambivalent about or disapproving of this market .
Certainly , the parties to the market exchange of prostitution are not culturally constructed in the same way that parties to other market exchanges are constructed .
The immense stigma that has traditionally been attached to female prostitution means that women who trade sex are not typically viewed merely as market actors – they are instead widely imagined and represented as sinful , sexually and morally depraved , or as vectors of disease , or as fallen or lost women , damaged victims .
All of these discourses about prostitution persist alongside an increasing sexualisation , even pornogrification , of consumer culture more generally , with very explicit sexual images used in the marketing of all manner of products .
They also co ##AT##-##AT## exist with more traditional boundary ##AT##-##AT## blurrings , for it has long been accepted that an economic value attaches to female sexuality and that this value can and should be realised through marriage to economically successful men .
Women &apos;s sexuality is thus understood , whether implicitly or explicitly , to have an exchange value , and yet it is still not generally regarded as something that can be separated from the person and traded as a commodity in prostitution without moral harm .
As Margaret Radin comments : &quot; Perhaps the best way to characterize the present situation is to say that women &apos;s sexuality is incompletely commodified &quot; .
This incomplete commodification clearly has some very negative consequences for many women who trade sex .
It means that the stigma associated with prostitution continues , and along with it not just a risk of rejection , hostility , even violence from family and community , but also often an inability to access basic rights , including the right to protection and justice .
In many countries , incomplete commodification further means that there is no regulatory regime in place to enforce contracts or protect those who sell sexual services from poor working conditions and exploitative employment relations .
And even in countries where prostitution is legal and regulated , the fact that prostitution is not regarded as a commodity exchange like any other , and that prostitutes are not viewed in the same way as other market actors means that the regulatory regime often imposes constraints and unfreedoms on sex workers that would not be imposed on other groups of workers or citizens .
In effect , incomplete commodificiation means that even where what they do is not actually illegal , prostitutes are excluded from &quot; civil society &quot; understood as &quot; a social , cultural and ethical system made up of the market , the legal system and voluntary associations to promote the welfare of the community &quot; &#91; 8 &#93; and this has very serious consequences for their social status and well being .
One response to this is to argue for the complete commodification of prostitution , in the sense of struggling to ensure that the objects , parties and norms of this market are reframed and understood in the same way as in other &quot; respectable &quot; markets , on grounds that this would make it possible for sex workers to be ethically incorporated into civil society , and so to benefit from full community inclusion .
This is the strategy pursued by many sex worker rights &apos; activists , who call both for the de ##AT##-##AT## stigmatization and decriminalization of prostitution and the application of labour law to the sex sector , arguing that if prostitution were regarded as a respectable , normal market like any other , the norms of exchange would fall into line with those in other legal and socially accepted markets .
It strikes me that this position is overly optimistic about the possibilities for , and potential consequences of , establishing sexual services as socially valued , or even morally neutral , objects of market exchange .
Consumer markets – whether in sex , other personal services , or goods – are sites in which a society &apos;s status hierarchies are reproduced , and this means that inequalities along lines of class , race , nation , age and gender do get played out symbolically and reinforced in practices of consumption .
It is not necessary to be morally conservative , abolitionist , anti ##AT##-##AT## pleasure or sex negative in order to feel uneasy about , say , the emergence of a sizeable market involving West African street workers and white clients in Spain , a country where there are no black female politicians , only a handful of black female professionals , few representations of black women as anything other than domestic workers or prostitutes on television and other media , and where anti ##AT##-##AT## African racism is routinely voiced .
However , the abolitionist response to the problem appears still more dangerous .
Measures to prevent men buying sex from street prostitutes and / or to suppress the most visible forms of prostitution are increasingly presented and justified as &quot; anti ##AT##-##AT## trafficking &quot; measures .
Leaving aside the many objections to such policies that are made by many groups concerned with the safety , human rights and civil liberties of women who work in street prostitution , it is clear that they are an inadequate response to links between consumer demand and the problem of forced labour in the sector as a whole .
Clamping down on demand for street prostitution does nothing to address – and may even strengthen – demand in other segments of the market , both legal and illegal , where forced / unfree labour can also be an issue ( pornography , escort agency prostitution , lap and table dance clubs , internet web ##AT##-##AT## cam sex , and so on ) .
Of course , it would be possible to extend the logic of the &quot; penalise the buyer &quot; approach to all forms of sex commerce : a total ban on all forms of sexualised entertainment and pornography involving actors / models ; raids on private homes and monitoring of private bank accounts to ensure that people are not using the internet to access sex workers ; phone taps to ensure that telephone sex is not being consumed .
But most would balk at the civil liberties implications of such an approach .
Given the political and moral problems posed by a policy of legal suppression , those who wish to see the commercial sex market shrink rather than continue to expand perhaps need to come up with more creative , less punitive and longer term strategies .
Third parties who employ sex workers in brothels , nightclubs , escort agencies , lap dance clubs and pimps who organise and financially benefit from another person &apos;s prostitution do not make decisions about employment practices , labour control and work organisation in a vacuum . Like all employers , they decide on strategies that are feasible and profitable in the particular social , legal and institutional context in which they operate .
The presence or absence of clear national employment conditions standards in settings such as lap ##AT##-##AT## dance establishments and , where legal , brothels , as well as of regular and effective monitoring and inspection in legal and &quot; irregular &quot; workplaces , clearly impacts on such decisions .
It is also important to recognise that whilst pimps and other third parties in the sex trade are often viewed as vile and immoral &quot; flesh peddlers &quot; , those who recruit labour for , and / or employ workers in the sex trade are not a socially , morally or politically homogeneous category of persons , and do not all adopt the same approach to their economic activity . A few may be crazed sociopaths , and at the other extreme , a few are committed to extremely ethical business practices .
Between are many ordinary people who , as human and social beings , need to tell themselves that their practices are normal , natural , necessary and / or inevitable , and so justified .
Prevailing social norms thus play an important role in shaping people &apos;s behaviour as &quot; employers &quot; in both legal and illegal segments of the commercial sex market . Third parties &apos; understanding of these norms is largely acquired by watching what others do and what the state allows them to get away with .
Indeed , it is depressing to observe how malleable most people are in terms of their morality in any market and how quickly they can adjust themselves to practices that they would previously have considered exploitative , providing no one stops them and others appear to be doing the same thing .
And so far as &quot; trafficking &quot; is concerned , it is also important to recognise that racism , xenophobia and prejudice against minority ethnic groups makes it much easier for employers , whether in the sex industry or any other sector , to tell themselves that exploitative labour practices are justified .
The racially / ethnically &quot; Other &quot; worker does not count as fully human , and so can be used and abused in ways that same race / ethnicity workers cannot be .
Women and girls who belong to groups that are in general socially devalued , and socially , politically and economically marginalized are also devalued by both employers and clients , and thus socially constructed as the &quot; natural &quot; or &quot; ideal &quot; occupants of the lowliest positions in the sex industry .
As with consumer demand , no single or clear ##AT##-##AT## cut policy implications follow . To the extent that the lack of application and enforcement of labour standards in the sex industry helps to create an environment in which it is possible and profitable to use unfree labour , I agree with the case for bringing the sex sector above ground and regulating it like any other industry .
But I also think it important to recognise that , for a number of reasons , the gains from this would be quite limited .
There are features of the sex sector that make it very difficult and very expensive to regulate effectively ( small units of employment , low start up costs , rapid turnover of labour and business establishments , geographical fluidity etc . ) .
And whether we are talking about the sex sector or any other &quot; difficult to regulate &quot; sector , governments are rarely willing to invest the level of resources that would be required to ensure that workers are all adequately protected .
Furthermore , there are features of custom and practice in many countries that make effective regulation difficult to implement , such as the practice whereby third parties who benefit from organising and controlling prostitution do not acknowledge themselves as direct employers , but instead treat prostitutes as self ##AT##-##AT## employed entrepreneurs who supposedly buy various services and / or rent facilities from the third party .
This is an arrangement that often conceals the imposition of very poor working conditions and a highly exploitative employment relation .
But at the same time , we cannot assume that those who sell sex always oppose it and would prefer a more regular , direct employment relation – they would not .
Many of those who prostitute do so on an irregular basis , using sex work as a means to pay off debts or save up for specific items , and would not wish to be subject to the discipline of a more permanent , visible and direct employment relation .
Indeed , visibility – something that is so central and necessary to the enforcement of basic minimum labour standards and employment protections – poses other dilemmas with regard to prostitution . Again , as with domestic work in private households , employers in the sex sector are often interested in migrants because their precarious position resulting from &quot; insecure legal status in the host country &quot; makes them less demanding and more flexible concerning working hours .
&#91; 10 &#93; But for many migrants who trade sex , becoming visible in the sense of their employment situation being subject to closer state regulation is more likely to mean being deported than it is to mean securing rights and protections as workers .
( Equally , where nationals work in prostitution to supplement poverty level benefits , visibility would more likely mean being prosecuted for benefit fraud than protection .
Those who trade sex are not a homogeneous group , and they position themselves in many different , complex and variable ways in relation to &quot; prostitution &quot; . At present , much sex commerce takes place in an unregulated underground , or an &quot; economy of makeshifts &quot; that stands outside civil society as defined above .
This remains the case even where a well ##AT##-##AT## regulated formal sector is established , as the existence of a legal sector does not mean that illegal or informal market segments automatically or necessarily disappear . The fact that prostitution is incompletely commodified is certainly one of the reasons why those who prostitute are still stigmatised and vulnerable to certain forms of abuse and exploitation , and there are some people who regard prostitution as a career and who would welcome the complete commodification of the commercial sex market .
But its incomplete commodification is also a reason why those who are already excluded from civil society ( eg , the very poor , runaway teenagers , drug addicts , undocumented migrants ) can turn to it as a means of survival . If prostitution were professionalised and incorporated into the &quot; moral economy &quot; as a legitimate and &quot; respectable &quot; form of work along the lines envisaged by some sex workers &apos; rights activists , it would not be open to these groups .
Moreover , many of those who turn to prostitution because they are dislocated , propertyless , and rightless do not approach prostitution as an occupation or a job as such , but merely as a strategy to get by . It is by no means clear that they would wish to be incorporated into civil society as a &quot; sex worker &quot; , even if this option was open to them .
Finally , regulation of the commercial sex industry does nothing , in itself , to counteract racism , xenophobia and prejudice against migrants and minority ethnic groups .
Indeed , the desire to apply and enforce labour standards in the sex industry can co ##AT##-##AT## exist with the wish to drive migrant women out of the sector .
Unless governments do something to address the social devaluation of migrants , and their social , political and economic marginalisation , regulation may merely serve to reinforce existing racial , ethnic , and national hierarchies in the sex industry .
&quot; Trafficking &quot; is often described as modern ##AT##-##AT## day slave trade , and for most people , this invokes images of women and children snatched from their homelands and forcibly transported to another land .
&#91; 13 &#93; The vast majority of eastern European , African , Latin American and Southeast Asian women and girls who end up in forced labour in prostitution in Western European countries wanted to migrate ( though not always to work in prostitution , and obviously never to be subject to forced labour in prostitution ) .
Furthermore , they invariably had good reason to want to migrate , which is why publicity about , and even personal experience of , the dangers associated with undocumented migration is rarely enough to stop people from taking the risk ( and also why some commentators refer to the repatriation of &quot; smuggled persons &quot; and &quot; victims of trafficking &quot; as &quot; reverse trafficking &quot; , i.e. , being moved against one &apos;s will across a border ) .
Similarly , interviews with 60 Moldovan adolescents who had been returned to Moldova found that almost all , including those who had been involved in prostitution abroad , wished to leave again ( indeed , some had been &quot; trafficked &quot; more than twice before ) .
&#91; 15 &#93; This should not surprise us , given that more than 50 per cent of the Moldovan population lives beneath a poverty threshold set at US $ 11.50 per month and that 30 per cent of Moldova &apos;s population is aged under 18 , and of them around 17 000 live ( or rather are held ) in grim and inadequately funded institutions for &quot; social orphans &quot; ( i.e. , children whose families are simply unable to support them ) .
In Moldova , for children and adults alike , labour migration is viewed as the only viable way to improve one &apos;s life ##AT##-##AT## chances , and remittances from migrants amount to 50 percent of Moldova &apos;s state budget .
Given that the conditions many migrants are seeking to escape are so bleak , violent and degrading , it is also hard to see why anyone genuinely concerned with protecting and promoting human rights would place measures to tackle consumer demand for commercial sex at the top of their policy agenda .
Measures to address poverty , global disparities of income , unemployment , gender inequalities , ethnic / racial conflict , political instability , etc .

Anyone who read the initial reports that the Czech writer Milan Kundera is alleged to have denounced the western agent Miroslav Dvorácek in 1950 could predict two things with certainty . First , that the events would be analyzed in the media according to the pattern of Stasi disclosure .
Second , that commentators would in some form or another make use of the title of Kundera &apos;s book , The Unbearable Lightness of Being .
Apparently , the twenty ##AT##-##AT## one year old student Milan Kundera appeared at a normal Prague police station to report that the twenty year ##AT##-##AT## old pilot Miroslav Dvorácek , who had escaped to West Germany and returned illegally to Prague , had left his suitcase in this or that student hall of residence , and would return to pick it up later that day .
Also aware of Dvorácek &apos;s visit apart from Kundera were Dvorácek &apos;s ex ##AT##-##AT## girlfriend Iva Militká and her new boyfriend Miroslav Dlask , both fellow students of Kundera at the Charles University .
Although the statement taken down at the police station is blemished by the failure to bear Kundera &apos;s signature and only his personal details , it is possible that such a document did indeed come to exist under the circumstances described . At any rate , Dvorácek , who was already on the wanted list , was arrested at the hall of residence that evening and put on trial .
Initially sentenced to death , he was later &quot; let off &quot; with a twenty ##AT##-##AT## two year prison sentence , fourteen of which he spent in one of Czechoslovakia &apos;s notorious uranium mines . Until the end , he was convinced that it was Militká who had betrayed him .
For years , she reproached herself for having talked to her boyfriend and later husband Dlask about her guest and thus involuntarily leading him into the hands of the authorities .
Dlask , on the other hand , may have looked upon the visitor as a competitor for Militka &apos;s affections , and moreover as someone who could have caused trouble for both of them .
Dlask then supposedly asked Kundera for help .
Today , Dvorácek lives in Stockholm and does not wish to comment directly about the affair .
Kundera , for his part , claims not to have known about the incident and views the publication of the Prague Institute as an &quot; assassination attempt &quot; .
Hence , we learn something about the &quot; what &quot; but not enough about the &quot; how &quot; and &quot; why &quot; in this tragic story .
In Czechoslovakia , the year 1950 stood very much in the shadow of the Great Terror , which was just beginning to gather momentum .
Fear of the system was gradually infiltrating the original atmosphere of socialist enthusiasm that had already been widespread in the pre ##AT##-##AT## war democracy . It began to take root in the minds and souls of the founding generation , who began to form a paranoid relationship to their own party .
The majority of the communist defendants in the show trials of the period , from the Slovak communist Vladimir &quot; Vlado &quot; Clementis to his colleague Rudolf Slansky , were charged with spying and treason and executed . Almost all were caught up in the cogs of the machinery that they themselves had helped to construct .
Twenty year ##AT##-##AT## olds at that time knew practically nothing about this situation and did not even have to be fanatic to denounce someone they thought they recognized as a class enemy .
If a person appeared in their circle who openly admitted having come from &quot; over there &quot; , in other words from behind the Iron Curtain , then in their eyes a failure to act was equal to complicity .
Moreover , they could assume that the mysterious acquaintance who had so suddenly surfaced was an agent provocateur for the secret police .
The absurdity of the situation became clear to them only years later . In probably his best novel , The Joke , Kundera himself wrote about the fate of an innocent culprit .
It is a story precisely about betrayal , love and ruined relationships – the central motifs of his later work .
Yet as concerns Miroslav , arrested back then in the student halls of residence , there is no reason retrospectively to turn him into a hero .
Spying against an unfree country is not automatically a freedom struggle , in the same way that the &quot; reconnaissance &quot; of an eastern European agent in the West was no peace mission .
Having said that , the young pilot may well have had noble motives , and to gather intelligence about conditions in his home country for the American Secret Services , during that spring of all times , required a courage that deserves a degree of admiration .
Nevertheless , there is the worry that , in his anti ##AT##-##AT## communist zeal , he was acting just as ignorantly as his contemporaries from the opposite side , and that his idealism was being exploited by his employers in a similar fashion .
At that time , to entrust such an obviously naive and ill ##AT##-##AT## prepared young man with such a task almost certainly meant placing him in a life ##AT##-##AT## threatening situation .
The draconian punishments and the barbarian conditions in the penal establishments must of course be blamed on the communist system , which in the twentieth century sacrificed hundreds of thousands – including many innocents – on the alter of its ideological insanity .
On one hand , the Kundera case can hardly be compared to the spying activities of other writers and artists .
Nevertheless , the manner of its publication creates some degree of likeness with the intellectual culprit ##AT##-##AT## victims exposed after 1990 as having worked for the various state security agencies : the StB , &#91; 1 &#93; the MfS , &#91; 2 &#93; Securitate , &#91; 3 &#93; Department III . / III . , &#91; 4 &#93; or the Derschawna Sigurnost .
&#91; 5 &#93; From this list it would not be hard to compile a crème de la crème of the eastern European intelligentsia ; at the same time , it is extremely important to distinguish between the cases and to check each on an individual basis .
What we are dealing with , namely , is a generation nearing the end of its life , which after the difficult formative years of the communist dictatorship attempted to free itself from the curse of its own past .
What is particularly sad about the careers of these protagonists is the fact that time and again they wanted to atone for their human and moral failure without being able to admit it .
Clearly , it was easier for them to act honestly then to speak openly .
Some things about the incident require further explanation . Only the court records and the investigation files can confirm how far the carelessly issued police statement actually played a role in the proceedings , or whether , for example , the three young people were summoned to appear before the court and if so , what their statements were .
It would also be of interest to find out the names of the officials who made the interrogation , the lawyers and the judge – questions that the authors of the revelations conspicuously fail to raise .
It could also prove to be the case that even with serious research , the relevant documents either fail to turn up or take a long time to find .
Until then , we should trust someone who during difficult times followed the principle of &quot; living in the truth &quot; , an attitude for which he made heavy sacrifices . Václav Havel warned the young historians to exercise caution when passing judgement on the youthful sins of a communist generation to which he himself never belonged .
Havel sees the author of The Joke suddenly forced into the Kunderaesque world of his own novels .
At the same time , he encourages his fellow writer , to whom he is bound more by argument than by friendship , with the moving words : &quot; Milan , rise above it ! There are worse things in life than being defamed by the press !

BK &apos;s Stereo ##AT##-##AT## Yashica - coupled 35mm cameras starting at 79 Euro , plus shipping .
Write to camera at exanova.com for additional Information .
I mostly feed Fuji &apos;s Sensia 100 and the results are outstanding ! In 1997 I made a pair of Nikon AF600 / Lite Touch , very compact combo , mounted vertically and stereo range from 50 centimeters to 5 meters , GREAT !
Then I have a pair of Pentax Super Program for better image quality and I &apos;m currently experimenting with two Canon EOS 1 and Voigtlander 15mm . The best stereophotos come with wide angles 24mm .. 32mm , and I also get stunning effects with 200 .. 300mm telephoto lenses on occasions .
My innovation consists of the combination of two identical point &amp; shoot 35mm cameras . Cameras have been combined before but often these were heavy and slow manual SLRs .
Modern consumer point &amp; shoot cameras produce better pictures than the Stereo Realists of the 50 &apos;s . But not any camera would do - although even disposable cameras would ( !
Not only have we got two ears but also two eyes . Stereo Photography is far older than the stereo audio we now take for granted in our everyday life .
That &apos;s because listening in stereo is easier than viewing stereo photos . In the 1950 &apos;s brands like Realist , TDC , Kodak , and many more created a craze that persists into the third millenium .
A few of the old folks are still around , but stereo cameras did not enjoy many of the advances in imaging technology over the late 20th century .
Either you make your own stereocamera or you work with cameras from the 50 &apos;s .
The two cameras autofocus system may be a problem to sync , some cameras use spot metering while others employ multi ##AT##-##AT## beam systems and there could be situations when one of the two cameras is out of sync .
The better AF camera models have an override function to focus on infinity .
Another sync problem can be exposure and use of flash , where one camera decides to fire and the other one does not .
But these cases are rare - when these cameras are well matched there is only 1 out of 40 photos affected by desychronization .
The question of shutter ##AT##-##AT## synchronizing two cameras is solved by attaching a common electrical switch to the two shutter release buttons . Easier said than done : Most point &amp; shoot do not allow for remote activation .

Author Hans Kwint has written an interesting article on his usage of Gentoo Linux on the desktop .
Entitled A Gentoo diary : Intro &quot; , it is the first in a series of articles on Gentoo usage in daily life .
The Linux Link Tech Show has a pretty long interview with four Gentoo developers , Mike Frysinger , Michael Cummings , Grant Goodyear , and Seemant Kulleen .
It can be downloaded in either OGG Vorbis or MP3 format .
The interview starts at about 24 1 / 2 minutes .
AnandTech recently did a shoot ##AT##-##AT## out of several different processors , including the Sun UltraSparc T1 .
For the article , they chose Gentoo Linux as the platform for the machines .
Check out the article to see how the new Sun CPU fares against Intel &apos;s Wood crest and AMD &apos;s Opteron .
While most of today &apos;s games won &apos;t run on Linux systems easily , there is still a wealth of options in yesterday &apos;s catalog that work great with an emulator .
If you can hunt down an original copy of the games , ScummVM will run some classic point ##AT##-##AT## and ##AT##-##AT## click adventure games such as &quot; Full Throttle &quot; , &quot; Day of the Tentacle &quot; and &quot; The Secret of Monkey Island .
The project first started out as a way to run old games that used LucasArt &apos;s SCUMM game engine , but now supports other games as well .
See the compatibility list for all the games it can run .
If you &apos;re not up to the task of hunting down computer games from the 1980s though , you &apos;re still in luck .
One such game has been released for free distribution -- Flight of the Amazon Queen , and it &apos;s available in portage .
To get up and running , first emerge scummvm on your system , which is already been marked stable on four architectures -- amd64 , ppc , sparc , and x86 .
ScummVM itself runs on many other platforms : Microsoft Windows , Mac OS X , PocketPC , PalmOS , OS / 2 and more .
Depending on your architecture , Flight of the Amazon Queen might be marked testing , so adjust your package.keywords file as necessary .
After that , add your user to the &apos; games &apos; group if you haven &apos;t already .
If you are adding your user to the group , remember that you must log out and back in before the changes will take effect .
Fire up scummvm , and it will open a graphical window where you can add your games .
By default , FOTAQ won &apos;t be displayed in the list , but you can add it by clicking &apos; Add Game &apos; .
The directory with game data is / usr / share / games / queen .
Once you navigate to that directory , simply click the &apos; Choose &apos; button .
You can also simply run &apos; queen &apos; to start the game directly .

Summary : This is the Gentoo Weekly Newsletter for the week of 26 June 2006 .
( Own report ) - German foreign policy makers , are upping their political pressure on Beijing , and holding talks with a Chinese separatist . As the Munich based &quot; World Uyghur Congress ( WUC ) &quot; announced , its president , Rebiya Kadeer will also be received by the foreign ministry .
The Uyghurs , a Muslim minority from the autonomous region Xinjiang ( Western China ) , are seeking the secession of their region &quot; East Turkestan &quot; from the People &apos;s Republic of China .
Rebiya Kadeer &apos;s appearance in the German capital has been carefully stage managed for high profile in conjunction with US activities . Following the Dalai Lama &apos;s German Chancellery visit , Berlin has been escalating its anti ##AT##-##AT## Beijing secessionist offensive .
Rebiya Kadeer is visiting Berlin shortly after the Dalai Lama ended his European tour that provoked strong protest from Beijing . In September , the head of the self proclaimed Tibetan exile government visited the Spanish province Catalonia that , after having gained extensive autonomy rights , is seeking secession .
The Munich based exile movement seeks to merge the Uyghur secessionist movement with the Tibetan and the Mongolian movements , to break up the Chinese nation from several of its peripheral regions .
In 1985 , former CIA advisor Alptekin participated in the foundation of the &quot; Allied Committee of the Peoples of East Turkestan , Tibet and Inner Mongolia &quot; . He supported in 1998 , an international conference in New York , organized by this Committee , where representatives of the US government were in attendance .
The strategy of ethnic movements is shared by the Dalai Lama . In his message of greetings to the conference in New York , he wrote : &quot; Geography , history and currently Chinese occupation is connecting our three peoples .

Sol y Nieve means great snow for skiing in Sierra Nevada Spain .
Sol y Nieve in Pradollano is the name of this amazing ski resort in the Sierra Nevada .
The sun is shining at 70 % of the days in one year !
Sol y nieve is situated in a hight of 2.100m til 3.300m above sea level . Therefore the snow quality is good even in the late spring time .
The andalusian sun has an important influence on the snow conditions as they will change during the day . The best time to enjoy fast but grippy slopes is between 9am and 13pm when the sun is slowly melting the frozen snow top layer .
Even if nature wouldn &apos;t support your snow holidays ( by keeping away the clouds to bring the fresh snow ) there are 428 snow canons to provide 31,8km of slopes with artificial snow .
Valderrama is ranked among the top 100 courses in the world , one of the top 10 in Europe and 1st in Spain .
Lush tree lined fairways and immaculate elevated greens give this course the recognition it so deserves .
The best players in the world have played it , and it has also been host to the Ryder Cup and the Volvo Masters .
Valderrama is a 6356 metres par 71 with no hole of less than championship quality but it can be fully enjoyed by players of all handicaps , thanks to the genius of Robert Trent Jones , Senior , whom many consider the leading golf architect of his day .
Each hole has a Professional tee ( 6356m ) , a Club Championship tee ( 5994m ) , an Executive tee ( 5498m ) and a Seniors &apos; tee ( 5053m ) , as well as a ladies Professional tee ( 5294m ) and a ladies Club tee ( 4873m ) . The tees are differentiated not just by distance but by careful siting .

SEO is an acronym for &quot; search engine optimization &quot; or &quot; search engine optimizer .
&quot; Deciding to hire an SEO is a big decision that can potentially improve your site and save time , but you can also risk damage to your site and reputation .
Make sure to research the potential advantages as well as the damage that an irresponsible SEO can do to your site .
Expertise in specific markets and geographies .
Keep in mind that the Google search results page includes organic search results and often paid advertisement ( denoted by the heading &quot; Sponsored Links &quot; ) as well .
Advertising with Google won &apos;t have any effect on your site &apos;s presence in our search results .
Google never accepts money to include or rank sites in our search results , and it costs nothing to appear in our organic search results .
Free resources such as Webmaster Tools , the official Webmaster Central blog , and our discussion forum can provide you with a great deal of information about how to optimize your site for organic search .
Many of these free sources , as well as information on paid search , can be found on Google Webmaster Central .
Before beginning your search for an SEO , it &apos;s a great idea to become an educated consumer and get familiar with how search engines work .
Google 101 : How Google crawls , indexes and serves the web .
If you &apos;re thinking about hiring an SEO , the earlier the better .
A great time to hire is when you &apos;re considering a site redesign , or planning to launch a new site .
That way , you and your SEO can ensure that your site is designed to be search engine ##AT##-##AT## friendly from the bottom up .
However , a good SEO can also help improve an existing site .
Can you show me examples of your previous work and share some success stories ?
Do you follow the Google Webmaster Guidelines ?
Do you offer any online marketing services or advice to complement your organic search business ?
What kind of results do you expect to see , and in what timeframe ?
How long have you been in business ?
How can I expect to communicate with you ?
Will you share with me all the changes you make to my site , and provide detailed information about your recommendations and the reasoning behind them ?
While SEOs can provide clients with valuable services , some unethical SEOs have given the industry a black eye through their overly aggressive marketing efforts and their attempts to manipulate search engine results in unfair ways .
Practices that violate our guidelines may result in a negative adjustment of your site &apos;s presence in Google , or even the removal of your site from our index .
Be wary of SEO firms and web consultants or agencies that send you email out of the blue .
Reserve the same skepticism for unsolicited email about search engines as you do for &quot; burn fat at night &quot; diet pills or requests to help transfer funds from deposed dictators .
No one can guarantee a # 1 ranking on Google .
Beware of SEOs that claim to guarantee rankings , allege a &quot; special relationship &quot; with Google , or advertise a &quot; priority submit &quot; to Google .
There is no priority submit for Google .
In fact , the only way to submit a site to Google directly is through our Add URL page or by submitting a Sitemap and you can do this yourself at no cost whatsoever .
Be careful if a company is secretive or won &apos;t clearly explain what they intend to do .
Ask for explanations if something is unclear .
If an SEO creates deceptive or misleading content on your behalf , such as doorway pages or &quot; throwaway &quot; domains , your site could be removed entirely from Google &apos;s index .
Ultimately , you are responsible for the actions of any companies you hire , so it &apos;s best to be sure you know exactly how they intend to &quot; help &quot; you .
You should never have to link to an SEO .
Avoid SEOs that talk about the power of &quot; free ##AT##-##AT## for ##AT##-##AT## all &quot; links , link popularity schemes , or submitting your site to thousands of search engines .
These are typically useless exercises that don &apos;t affect your ranking in the results of the major search engines -- at least , not in a way you would likely consider to be positive .
While you consider whether to go with an SEO , you may want to do some research on the industry .
Google is one way to do that , of course .
You might also seek out a few of the cautionary tales that have appeared in the press , including this article on one particularly aggressive SEO : http : / / seattletimes.nwsource.com / html / businesstechnology / 2002002970 ##UNDERSCORE## nwbizbriefs12.html .
While Google doesn &apos;t comment on specific companies , we &apos;ve encountered firms calling themselves SEOs who follow practices that are clearly beyond the pale of accepted business behavior .
Be sure to understand where the money goes .
While Google never sells better ranking in our search results , several other search engines combine pay ##AT##-##AT## per ##AT##-##AT## click or pay ##AT##-##AT## for ##AT##-##AT## inclusion results with their regular web search results .
Some SEOs will promise to rank you highly in search engines , but place you in the advertising section rather than in the search results .
A few SEOs will even change their bid prices in real time to create the illusion that they &quot; control &quot; other search engines and can place themselves in the slot of their choice .
This scam doesn &apos;t work with Google because our advertising is clearly labeled and separated from our search results , but be sure to ask any SEO you &apos;re considering which fees go toward permanent inclusion and which apply toward temporary advertising .
What are the most common abuses a website owner is likely to encounter ?
One common scam is the creation of &quot; shadow &quot; domains that funnel users to a site by using deceptive redirects .
These shadow domains often will be owned by the SEO who claims to be working on a client &apos;s behalf .
However , if the relationship sours , the SEO may point the domain to a different site , or even to a competitor &apos;s domain .
If that happens , the client has paid to develop a competing site owned entirely by the SEO .
Another illicit practice is to place &quot; doorway &quot; pages loaded with keywords on the client &apos;s site somewhere .
The SEO promises this will make the page more relevant for more queries .
This is inherently false since individual pages are rarely relevant for a wide range of keywords .
More insidious , however , is that these doorway pages often contain hidden links to the SEO &apos;s other clients as well .
Such doorway pages drain away the link popularity of a site and route it to the SEO and its other clients , which may include sites with unsavory or illegal content .
What are some other things to look out for ?
There are a few warning signs that you may be dealing with a rogue SEO .
It &apos;s far from a comprehensive list , so if you have any doubts , you should trust your instincts .
If you feel that you were deceived by an SEO in some way , you may want to report it .
In the United States , the Federal Trade Commission ( FTC ) handles complaints about deceptive or unfair business practices .
If your complaint is against a company in a country other than the United States , please file it at http : / / www.econsumer.gov / .

Dangriga Town , formerly known as Stann Creek Town , is a town in southern Belize , located on the Caribbean coast at the mouth of Stann Creek .
It is the capital of Belize &apos;s Stann Creek District and also forms its own constituency .
Dangriga was settled in or slightly before 1832 by Garifuna ( Black Caribs , as they were known to the British ) from Honduras .
It was for a long time the second largest population centre in the country behind Belize City , but in recent years has been surpassed by Orange Walk Town . The population is mostly a mixture of Garinagu , Kriols and Mestizos .
Dangriga takes it name from the local Garifuna language , loosely meaning &quot; here , the sweet water is close at hand .
&quot; It lies peacefully along the banks of the North Stann Creek River , whose water is legendary . The town &apos;s drinking supply is refreshingly cool and arguably the best tasting in Belize .

Learn the theory behind XRF spectrometry with this short interactive flash movie .
Although more popularly known for its diagnostic use in the medical field , the use of x ##AT##-##AT## rays forms the basis of many other powerful measurement techniques , including X ##AT##-##AT## ray Fluorescence ( XRF ) Spectrometry .
XRF Spectrometry is used to identify elements in a substance and quantify the amount of those elements present to ultimately determine the elemental composition of a material .
An element is identified by its characteristic X ##AT##-##AT## ray emission wavelength ( λ ) or energy ( E ) .
The amount of an element present is quantified by measuring the intensity ( I ) of its characteristic emission .
All atoms have a fixed number of electrons ( negatively charged particles ) arranged in orbitals around the nucleus .
Energy Dispersive ( ED ) XRF and Wavelength Dispersive ( WD ) XRF Spectrometry typically utilize activity in the first three electron orbitals , the K , L , and M lines , where K is closest to the nucleus .
In XRF Spectrometry , high ##AT##-##AT## energy primary X ##AT##-##AT## ray photons are emitted from a source ( X ##AT##-##AT## ray tube ) and strike the sample .
The primary photons from the X ##AT##-##AT## ray tube have enough energy to knock electrons out of the innermost , K or L , orbitals .
When this occurs , the atoms become ions , which are unstable .
An electron from an outer orbital , L or M , will move into the newly vacant space at the inner orbital to regain stability .
As the electron from the outer orbital moves into the inner orbital space , it emits an energy known as a secondary X ##AT##-##AT## ray photon .
The secondary X ##AT##-##AT## ray produced is characteristic of a specific element .
The energy ( E ) of the emitted fluorescent X ##AT##-##AT## ray photon is determined by the difference in energies between the initial and final orbitals of the individual transitions .
where h is Planck &apos;s constant ; c is the velocity of light ; and λ is the characteristic wavelength of the photon .
Energies are inversely proportional to the wavelengths ; they are characteristic for each element .
For example the Kα energy for Iron ( Fe ) is about 6.4keV.
Typical spectra for EDXRF Spectrometry appear as a plot of Energy ( E ) versus the Intensity ( I ) .
XRF Spectrometry is the choice of many analysts for elemental analysis .
XRF Spectrometry easily and quickly identifies and quantifies elements over a wide dynamic concentration range , from PPM levels up to virtually 100 % by weight .
XRF Spectrometry does not destroy the sample and requires little , if any , sample preparation .
It has a very fast overall analysis turnaround time .
These factors lead to a significant reduction in the per sample analytical cost when compared to other elemental analysis techniques .
Aqueous elemental analysis instrument techniques typically require destructive and time ##AT##-##AT## consuming specimen preparation , often using concentrated acids or other hazardous materials .
Not only is the sample destroyed , waste streams are generated during the analysis process that need to be disposed of , many of which are hazardous .
These aqueous elemental analysis techniques often take twenty minutes to several hours for sample preparation and analysis time .
All of these factors lead to a relatively high cost per sample .
However , if PPB and lower elemental concentrations are the primary measurement need , aqueous instrument elemental analysis techniques are necessary .
All elemental analysis techniques experience interferences , both chemical and physical in nature , and must be corrected or compensated for in order to achieve adequate analytical results .
Most aqueous instrument techniques for elemental analysis suffer from interferences that are corrected for by extensive and complex sample preparation techniques , instrumentation modifications or enhancements , and by mathematical corrections in the system &apos;s software .
In XRF Spectrometry , the primary interference is from other specific elements in a substance that can influence ( matrix effects ) the analysis of the element ( s ) of interest .
However , these interferences are well known and documented ; and , instrumentation advancements and mathematical corrections in the system &apos;s software easily and quickly correct for them .
In certain cases , the geometry of the sample can affect XRF analysis , but this is easily compensated for by selecting the optimum sampling area , grinding or polishing the sample , or by pressing a pellet or making glass beads .
Quantitative elemental analysis for XRF Spectrometry is typically performed using Empirical Methods ( calibration curves using standards similar in property to the unknown ) or Fundamental Parameters ( FP ) .
FP is frequently preferred because it allows elemental analysis to be performed without standards or calibration curves .
This enables the analyst to use the system immediately , without having to spend additional time setting up individual calibration curves for the various elements and materials of interest .
The capabilities of modern computers allow the use of this no ##AT##-##AT## standard mathematical analysis , FP , accompanied by stored libraries of known materials , to determine not only the elemental composition of an unknown material quickly and easily , but even to identify the unknown material itself .
Innov ##AT##-##AT## X Systems utilizes the EDXRF Spectrometer technique for its mechanical simplicity and excellent adaptation to portable field use .
An EDXRF system typically has three major components : an excitation source , a spectrometer / detector , and a data collection / processing unit .
The ease of use , rapid analysis time , lower initial purchase price and substantially lower long ##AT##-##AT## term maintenance costs of EDXRF Spectrometers have led to having more systems in use today worldwide than WDXRF Spectrometer systems .
Handheld , field portable EDXRF units can be taken directly to the sample as opposed to bringing the sample to the analyzer and configuring it to fit in an analysis chamber .
Innov ##AT##-##AT## X Systems portable , handheld EDXRF units solve real 21 st century application problems : solving crimes , analyzing alloys , exposing pollution , preserving history , searching for WMD &apos;s , conserving art treasures , and a myriad of other elemental field ##AT##-##AT## oriented analyses .

&quot; Your music reflects the Austrian landscape : the vineyards , the golden leaves of autumn , the brilliant sky overhead , melancholy and kindness , vitality and life , a dream , romantically bewitching Austria . Your strength of character cannot be contained by the borders of this land ; you rejected all devils &apos; bargains , and made no concession to conquerors and rulers .
Your imagination is not a retreat from reality , and what rings the truest , is a courageous heart . It is also the wellspring of your mood , which is in opposition to Austrian sloppiness , namely attacks against all overblown , disrespectful dialog about authority .
And that , in this place , is to be praised above all else . Therefore , thank you , dear Sir , for your artistry and your courage .
It isn &apos;t widely known outside Austria that for decades in his homeland , Joseph Marx has been closely associated with the Nazi regime .
This belief led to &quot; denunciations &quot; as well as labels such as &quot; Marx , the Nazi boot ##AT##-##AT## licker &quot; or &quot; Nazi ##AT##-##AT## lover . &quot; Some even believe Marx was a card ##AT##-##AT## carrying Nazi .
The following observation is presented in the form of a comparison of questions and facts that will serve as clarification of not only this subject , but can also be partly transferred to other artists of that era , and should help the reader form an objective opinion . The information collected here is drawn from the biographies and writings listed in the &quot; Bibliography , &quot; and also relies heavily on dozens of interviews I conducted with persons who worked and interacted privately with Joseph Marx .
Was Marx a Nazi sympathizer or at least , a conformist ?
As an outspoken individualist and completely devoted to art and music , Marx never in his life joined a specific political movement . Based on his conservative views of tonality and composition , and his long ##AT##-##AT## established position as one of the leading music teachers in Austria it was in the Ministry of Propaganda &apos;s best interests to exploit Marx for specific political purposes ( as it happened with many other artists and cultural figures of the time ) .
This is most evident in that Marx presented lectures in which he especially praised the performance activity and the multi ##AT##-##AT## faceted nature of musical life in the Nazi state . It must be noted that in these lectures Marx avoided concrete political pronouncements and limited himself to the evaluation of efforts in the musical arena particularly in the areas of cultural and musical heritage and suggestions pertinent to that ; in other words , to themes over which he could exercise his own judgment .
In the interests of self ##AT##-##AT## preservation , Marx , a well ##AT##-##AT## respected figure throughout Austria long before the Nazi seizure of power , had to conduct himself diplomatically and trod a very dangerous balancing act .
The Ministry of Propaganda had the means and the power to place uncooperative artists in the worst possible situations , in which performances or exhibitions of their works would be banned .
Far ##AT##-##AT## reaching measures were in place , through which people could simply be removed from their jobs and their assets seized , and all too often notes and manuscripts would be confiscated ; compositions and literary works by many non ##AT##-##AT## Jewish artists were also burned or otherwise destroyed and lost forever .
It is all too often forgotten that at that time , Marx the composer , who for decades was the ambivalent central figure of tonal music in Austria , was under constant threat of displacement by proponents of the rapidly developing Avant ##AT##-##AT## garde . It can be deduced that he sought to use his lectures as a platform for the advancement of his own musical viewpoint , with which he went so far as to try to be a positive legislative influence on the cultural development of the populace .
In light of this situation , it is interesting that Marx , in the final days of the Nazi regime , turned down numerous invitations to speak with patently absurd excuses that were completely unacceptable to the Reich Propaganda Office , for example , &quot; I have to administer a test &quot; or better still , &quot; I don &apos;t have any money for carfare , &quot; to which the propaganda office , by the way , promised to send him a train ticket .
From my conversations with Marx &apos;s surviving friends the following impression is formed . Marx had to have been a charismatic and free ##AT##-##AT## spirited non ##AT##-##AT## conformist , who in meetings with Nazi functionaries &quot; spoke his mind &quot; with no regard for consequences and &quot; in now way allowed himself to be taken advantage of &quot; .
One of my interviewees told me a number of anecdotes that proved beyond all doubt that Marx was a master of irony and was not afraid to make Nazi functionaries &quot; look like fools &quot; .
It allows one thing to be said with certainty , namely that in the fifties , Marx began a slow retreat from public life and focused himself on his never ##AT##-##AT## conquered inner connection with nature and its mystical connection with art . Marx described this directly in the revealing ORF interviews from 1952 , saying that he had remained fundamentally connected with Nature during his entire life , and this connection had sustained his well ##AT##-##AT## known effusiveness .
At this point it should be briefly mentioned that even before his philosophical studies , Marx already had a metaphysical worldview .
In many private letters Marx , who placed a high demand on the cultural level of a nation and was universally recognized as a literary and artistically educated person , expressed his sorrow over the rampant decay of values between the two world wars and the accompanying waning of concern for ethics and spiritual matters .
It should also be noted here that in the majority of his letters Marx expressed the heartfelt wish to see his distant friends more often , so that finally , they could again have the deep discussions that he treasured so much .
Marx constantly strove to meet the high ideals of &quot; lofty art &quot; in the manner of the traditional masters he revered : Mozart , Haydn , Schubert , Beethoven , Brahms , etc .
His famous motto &quot; Not everything that has been composed should be called music &quot; is indicative of his viewpoint that music should play within the borders of tonality , although he did expand those borders somewhat , and not only in selected passages of his own work , but ironically also in the evaluation of modern works , as Marx also praised the works of those Modern composers who at least included tonal elements in their pieces ( it is interesting in this situation that he once sought to bring Schönberg to the Vienna Academy of Music ) .
His extreme criticism of the Avant ##AT##-##AT## garde manifested itself long before the birth of the anti ##AT##-##AT## Semitic Nazi regime .
On the other hand , Marx had many friends among atonal composers that went much deeper than a &quot; peaceful coexistence &quot; .
Many of his students who had already broken away from the tonal System during their educations , later reported that their relationship with their teacher Marx was always marked by mutual respect and understanding , and they were grateful for the comprehensive musical education that he provided .
Marx &apos;s students and other survivors told me that many Jews were also among his large circle of friends and acquaintances .
When questioned about it specifically , they maintained that Marx showed absolutely no tendency toward racism or anti ##AT##-##AT## Semitism , but that there was never a more open ##AT##-##AT## minded , dearer man , for whom a person &apos;s race or origins made no difference .
Erich Wolfgang Korngold , as we know , who throughout his lifetime was a friend of Marx &apos;s , happened to be Jewish - as was Franz Schreker , who likewise belonged to Marx &apos;s closest circle of colleagues and friends . In addition , the titles of Marx &apos;s compositions and his song texts contain not even the remotest hint of Nazi , or indeed anti ##AT##-##AT## Semitic sentiment .
Further , I have in my possession a collection of letters in which enduring friendships between Marx and numerous colleagues and friends who were persecuted and expelled for their Jewish beliefs are documented .
Yet another interesting example of Marx &apos;s versatile personality is found in a conversation with a family with whom Marx had been close friends for many years , and who told me that he used his position as district music director , as was his official title for a while , to help Jews .
New information , supported by countless letters and documented evidence readily found in the collections of the National Library casts him in a completely different light - that Marx constantly did all in his power to reestablish performances of the works of Jewish composers in Austria &apos;s concert halls .
This would have been a further reason for his occasional acquiescence to the plans of Nazi functionaries ; if he had openly rebelled against them , he could have certainly kissed his influential position in the music world goodbye , that had made it possible for him to assist those countless ( not a few from Jewish refugees ) inquiries .
Korngold is the best ##AT##-##AT## known example , but there are many letters from Jewish artists , who sought assistance from Marx even long after World War II . The sheer number of requests and thank ##AT##-##AT## you letters shows that Marx had to have been not only the court of last resort , but the first for his Jewish colleagues and students .
One can only guess at the difficult and likely critical situations in which Marx had to maneuver himself , as he showed the countless artists who had flown Austria or had been driven out by the Nazis ways to regain a foothold in their homeland .
A definitive impression begins to form of Joseph Marx &apos;s character , for as has already been mentioned in his biography , Marx gave extra lessons to many of his students who needed them , indeed often holding private , free sessions during his free time .
Based on his enormous willingness to help and the high esteem in which he was held , it is all the more astounding , indeed almost unbelievable that he has been labeled a Nazi sympathizer for so long .
Not a few of his Jewish students and friends traveled from America back to Austria after the war solely to visit their highly ##AT##-##AT## regarded teacher and friend Joseph Marx , as was the case with Herbert Zipper . That Marx was revered by the great majority of his students and was honored up until his death with countless letters and visits from all parts of the world is already known , but from whence his enormous esteem for his Jewish students comes , is uncertain .
In the meantime , a newly disclosed packet of letters has brought to light that Marx assisted numerous Jewish families who enlisted his aid by securing homes and positions in foreign lands , which means that he has rescued them from deportation .
In addition Marx , as evidenced by his letters , constantly did all in his power to see to it that combat soldiers whom he knew personally ( for example , his students ) , and their units would be entertained , among other things by the organization of musical events that the troops attended , and in which they often participated .
Marx &apos;s house maid who experienced him in the years 1938 ##AT##-##AT## 43 ( Austria was taken over by the Nazi regime in March 1938 ) , reported to me that Marx never supported those Austrians who followed the Germanizing of Austria by the Nazi propaganda machinery . The &quot; Hitler salute &quot; was not tolerated in Marx &apos;s house .
As a reminder : We are discussing the same person who is still branded a Nazi collaborator in many poorly informed circles of the Austrian music world !
Could one from this , at least , deduce a tendency towards a national socialistic viewpoint ? This point is mentioned , only because Marx was first and foremost an artist and creative person , who owed much of his inspiration to Austrian culture and , indeed , the entire realm of German ##AT##-##AT## speaking poets , composers and thinkers .
It is a generally recognized and acknowledged fact today , that because of the politically charged atmosphere of that decade , not only Marx , but many other important artists , musicians and literary figures of his time were persuaded to mouth the party line , without being accused of having an overly zealous association with the Nazis .
If this is a legitimate question , would it not be analogous , for example , to reach the grotesque conclusion that also the etymologists and assorted clubs who for years have sought to preserve the purity of the German language , should also be accused of having a strong nationalistic , perhaps even Nazi Attitude ?
Jewish composer Herbert Zipper ( survivor of the Nazi concentration camp in Dachau ) who wrote the famous &quot; Dachau ##AT##-##AT## Lied &quot; , travelled from the USA to Austria in 1956 only with the intention of seeing again his &quot; revered teacher and friend &quot; Joseph Marx . Remember : This is the same Joseph Marx who in Austria has been publicly accused of having been a powerful Nazi .
So what really happened in Austria between the two world wars and after World War 2 , and what has this got to with the neglect of Marx &apos;s music during the last couple of decades ?
The main problem has two sides : Musicology and cultural policy .
Musicology : In the years 1905 ##AT##-##AT## 09 , Marx has made huge experiments by working with thousands of subjects of different ages and different levels of education . These experiments showed him that tonality most probably is a universal law deeply connected with human perception and psychology .
Marx &apos;s experiments that were unprecedented until that time and that widely developped Riemann &apos;s theories of the 19th century , were worked out with Alexius von Meinong and Vittorio Benussi who were among Austria &apos;s leading experimental psychologists of that era . After evaluating all the results in 1909 , Marx literally HAD TO believe that all atonal , polytonal and other possible ways of &quot; intellectual construction &quot; of tone structures must be &quot; against a universal principle &quot; .
Nevertheless , it was certainly unfair of him that he sometimes abused his authority to put obstacles in the way of young Avantgarde musicians , but one should be aware that Marx was just one of the leading figures of a whole Austrian generation who did that . And so we have to talk about the second side of the problem : Cultural politics .
The Austrian music between 1922 ( when Marx became powerful and at the same time the twelfe ##AT##-##AT## tone music was founded ) and approximately 1960 , was divided into two groups , the tonalists and the members of the Second Viennese School of Arnold Schoenberg ( including their following younger generation ) . The atonalists ( many of which , ironically , were formerly taught by Joseph Marx !
They also had important representants in functionary roles of Austria &apos;s cultural and musical life . There was an open battle between the two groups .
He occasionally abused his authority in order to suppress the Avantgarde in the open battle between tonal and atonal Austrian musicians .
Amazingly , the archive doesn &apos;t mention a single negative word about Marx . Nevertheless , parts of the Austrian music scene still believe that Marx was a powerful Nazi sympathizer , and this mistake was intentionally created by an Avantgarde generation after Marx &apos;s death who then suppressed performances of his music and spread around Nazi accusations against him although everything untrue ( as you can read in the other parts of this article ) and although he , already dead , was unable to defend himself .
Because Austria has a HUGE problem with its own Nazi history of the period after 1938 ( when Austria was taken over by Nazi Germany ) . Almost every Austrian has or had relatives who became an active Nazi after Austria had been &quot; swallowed &quot; by the Nazi regime in March 1938 .
So this topic still is a kind of taboo in Austria , and it &apos;s totally different from Germany where the last two generations have accepted and exposed all of the guilts of their fathers and grandfathers by making hundreds of TV documentations , exhibitions and other stuff .
This is why many open ##AT##-##AT## minded Austrians wrote to me that they are so grateful that someone supports this process of &quot; freeing the mind &quot; and exposes the truth about Joseph Marx after such a long time of lies and unconfirmed rumors .
It would still be impossible to do that in Austria . &quot; ( One must know that I live in Germany ) .
The preceding evidence shows that the accusations against Joseph Marx are based largely on a distortion , or at least ignorance of , many factors . One gains the impression that those who laid the foundation for these accusations did not take into account the entire course of events , but rather had to have pulled events out of context .
This may have been done with the intent to sow a specific opinion about Marx that the true circumstances of his time can hardly reflect , and cannot in any way do a complex personality like Marx justice . But one must also guard against judging those instigators of these widely held , rash beliefs in a similar , biased manner : After all , prior to the establishment of this Internet site , there existed no comprehensive , published body of research in which all of the above facts were assembled and available in their entirety .
It is for exactly this reason that I have written this essay : to enlighten and recall that the quest for truth is always the best way to illuminate and observe things from all sides , to remain ready to challenge long ##AT##-##AT## held beliefs , even to completely reconsider them . At any rate , one occasionally has to throw some old ways of thinking overboard and thus remain open to abandon accepted truths , rather than to choose to believe only what makes us comfortable .
And , ironically , many find this unbearably difficult . But to summarize objectively : Who would want to be trade places with someone who , already long before the rise of National Socialism , had led a public life , and was automatically under pressure after the takeover of the Nazi regime ?
Is it possible to render an objective verdict on people like Joseph Marx for the difficult decisions such as what they had to make in that time , the weight of which we today can &apos;t comprehend , in some way judge them ?
Now is the time for Joseph Marx to receive the well ##AT##-##AT## deserved praise that Austrian music of the 20th century , as well as uncounted musicians the world over , owe him .
With heartfelt thanks to Mrs. Rosemary Hilmar from the Austrian National Library ( Manuscript Collection ) for her untiring work in the development of the collections of musicians &apos; correspondence administered by the National Library , Vienna .

Olympus E ##AT##-##AT## 510 digital SLR camera review : Olympus is making waves with the digital SLR cameras .
The models are quickly being improved and renewed .
We still await the successor of the E ##AT##-##AT## 1 ( Olympus E ##AT##-##AT## 3 ) , but the Olympus E ##AT##-##AT## 510 D ##AT##-##AT## SLR gives us a taste of what is to come .
The Olympus E ##AT##-##AT## 510 is the successor of the E ##AT##-##AT## 500 , which was released more than a year and a half ago .
The changes made to the E ##AT##-##AT## 400 in the E ##AT##-##AT## 410 were minimal , but the Olympus E ##AT##-##AT## 510 digital SLR is truly different from its predecessor .
Olympus uses a Panasonic sensor for the E ##AT##-##AT## 510 instead of a Kodak sensor .
As the name suggests , the Olympus E ##AT##-##AT## 510 also has Live View , just like other Olympus models have .
Live View is now definitively the future of the DSLR .
Not only Olympus and Panasonic are applying this , but also Canon and Nikon have included Live View in their new DSLR products .
At first Olympus and Panasonic were looked upon with pity when they first showed the Live View , but quickly it appeared to be a consumer advantage .
Next to the new sensor the amount of pixels has increased .
The Olympus E ##AT##-##AT## 510 now has ten Megapixels , the same amount as the E ##AT##-##AT## 410 .
This amount of resolution allows for large prints .
The signal is processed differently than in the E ##AT##-##AT## 410 , though , so that we can expect different results .
Thanks to the SuperSonic Wave Filter placed in front of the sensor , you do not longer have to worry about having to retouch a lot of dust spots .
This is great , because with ten Megapixels you can see almost every detail .
The filter in front of the sensor shakes and the sensor itself can move as well .
This has allowed Olympus to integrate a physical image stabilizer .
You do not need special lenses in order to prevent blur from camera shake .
The dimensions have hardly changed at all .
The camera is a bit wider and a bit thinner and longer as well .
The camera still has a lot in common with the legendary Olympus OM series .
The compact body is partly possible because of the FourThirds System , of which Olympus is one of the pioneers .
The sensor format is half the size of a 35 mm film .
The focal range has a factor of 2 , so that a 14 ##AT##-##AT## 45 mm lens behaves as a 28 ##AT##-##AT## 90 mm lens would ( on a 35 mm camera ) .
The whole system is easy to carry with you .
The FourThirds System keeps expanding , not only with new cameras , but with new lenses , including a few real top models .
While we tested the Olympus Evolt E ##AT##-##AT## 510 , we also had a few lenses at our disposal , including the Zuiko Digital 7 ##AT##-##AT## 14mm 1 : 4 ED .
It is an ultra wide ##AT##-##AT## angle lens , but not quite a fisheye .
On a 35 mm camera it would be equivalent to a 14 ##AT##-##AT## 28 mm lens .
This is a very interesting range for photojournalists and landscape photographers .
We have tested an Olympus E ##AT##-##AT## 510 and a few lenses for a while in our test lab .
The results can be read in the next Olympus E ##AT##-##AT## 510 review .
Nikon D60 digital SLR camera review : Nikon changed direction with the introduction of the D40 in 2006 and the D40x in 2007 .
The digital SLR camera was allowed to become compact and one should be able to carry it around just as easily as a compact camera .
Of course there are limits from a technical point of view as to how compact a DSLR can get , but it &apos;s definitely a great achievement to develop a compact digital SLR camera and keep it easy to handle at the same time .
Nikon is continuing the concept of the D40 / D40x with the introduction of the Nikon D60 .
The resolution of the Nikon D60 remained the same ; with 10.2 Megapixels the camera sticks to the &apos; standard &apos; resolution for entry ##AT##-##AT## level digital SLR camera models .
The D60 uses the technology that has also been applied in the warmly welcomed D300 .
The EXPEED image processor inside the Nikon D60 ensures achieving the highest possible image quality as an end result .
The auto focus unit is Nikon &apos;s Multi ##AT##-##AT## CAM 530 AF sensor module with TTL phase detection and a 3 point AF system .
The image sensor delivers an ISO sensitivity of 100 - 1600 and offers the possibility to compensate the sensitivity with one extra step to ISO 3200 .
Compared with the D40x , the speed of action photography remained the same .
The 3 fps make Nikon keep pace with their competitors .
For a DSLR camera of the entry ##AT##-##AT## level segment this speed is sufficient for capturing fast moments .
A very important new feature for Nikon &apos;s entry ##AT##-##AT## level model is the integration of an anti ##AT##-##AT## dust system .
Such a system is always the first thing on a photographer &apos;s wish ##AT##-##AT## list while it prevents disappointments and a lot of editing afterwards .
That &apos;s why I am very pleased with the so ##AT##-##AT## called Airflow Control System since dust is an annoying phenomenon that every DSLR photographer has experienced in his photography career .
An additional novelty is the eye ##AT##-##AT## sensor deactivating the LCD monitor as soon as the optical viewfinder is used .
The energy consumption of the Nikon D60 will certainly benefit from this feature .
The wind has been with Nikon over the last few years .
The developments on the field of DSLR are fast but Nikon keep pace with great ease .
Products with important and great innovations appear in nearly every segment .
I can &apos;t say otherwise ; Nikon impress me hugely with what they have achieved lately .
An innovator like Nikon is enrichment for photography and adds greatly to the enthusiasm of amateur and professional photographers who are using their tools in a creative way .
I have had the possibility to test the new Nikon D60 in practice together with a Nikkor AF ##AT##-##AT## S DX 18 ##AT##-##AT## 55mm f / 3.5 ##AT##-##AT## 5.6 G VR lens .
Beforehand I qualified the D60 as a successor to the Nikon D40x but officially there is no mentioning of it being a successor .
We therefore will not say goodbye to the D40x but welcome a new Nikon family member ; the Nikon D60 .
My findings can be read in the following Nikon D60 review .

Hazrat Salaheddin Ali Nader Angha , Present Sufi Master of M.T.O.
Molana Salaheddin Ali Nader Angha , known as Hazrat Pir , is the 42nd Sufi in a continuous succession of Sufi Masters dating back 1400 years to the time of the Holy Prophet Muhammad ( peace and blessings upon him ) .
Esoteric knowledge was transmitted by the Holy Prophet of Islam to Imam Ali ( peace be upon him ) , Oveys Gharani ( Uways al ##AT##-##AT## Qarani ) , and Salman Farsi and then handed down through this unbroken chain of Sufi Masters to the present time .
Hazrat Pir was born in Tehran , Iran , on Sunday noon , the 30th of September 1945 .
His spiritual journey began in childhood , when special signs were seen in him .
For eleven years , he was under the tutelage of his grandfather , who was the 40th Sufi Master of the Oveyssi School .
He then pursued his studies under the direct guidance of his father , Molana ##AT##-##AT## al ##AT##-##AT## Moazam Hazrat Shah Maghsoud Sadegh Angha , known as Professor Angha .
On September 4 , 1970 , his father confirmed Nader Angha ’ s spiritual leadership with the Robe of Faqr .
Hazrat Shah Maghsoud , with a speech , handed over his Robe to him .
From the date of his appointment by the hand of his beloved father , Hazrat Pir assumed his responsibilities in carrying on the duties entrusted to him , which included the design and supervision of the construction of the magnificent Sufi Center in Sufi ##AT##-##AT## Abad of Karaj ( close to Tehran ) .
Dr. Ronald Grisell , who travelled to Iran in 1983 , sought and was granted permission to visit the Maktab Tarighat Oveyssi Shahmaghsoudi Oveyssi School at Sufi ##AT##-##AT## Abad of Karaj .
In 1979 , when Hazrat Pir moved to the United States with his father , he began to execute his father &apos;s wish to expand the sacred teachings to a wider audience .
In a short period of time and under his direct guidance and supervision , the teaching sessions started in many states of the USA .
In fact , after the passing away of Hazrat Shah Maghsoud , the duty of propagating the true message of Islam across the world rests on his shoulder .
Such a mission he has taken with such love and dedication and ceaselessly endeavor to guide , help and teach and reveal the true features of Islam to mankind , whatever their school of thought , creed or religions and upbringing .
Hazrat Pir &apos;s knowledge is not limited to the esoteric disciplines and sacred sciences ( science of letters and numbers , alchemy , etc . ) , but expands to other disciplines , including : physics , mathematics , astronomy , astrophysics , quantum mechanics , biophysics , philosophy , poetry , and architecture .
He has invented a device which produces Muon Rays to be used in Muontherapy to heal nerves and other systems in human bodies .
Hazrat Pir &apos;s insight , receptivity , and meticulous mind have won the respect of scholars and scientists around the world .
Hazrat Pir has delivered lectures at many of the leading universities in the West , and at other scientific and educational institutions .
His discourses focus on presenting the depth of the spirituality in Islam , its scientific richness , and its relevance for contemporary life .
It is his conviction that unless each person &apos;s inherent goodness , talents , and abilities are developed , one cannot know the meaning of stability , security , freedom and human dignity .
Hazrat Pir &apos;s more than 50 books include works of prose and poetry - Peace , The Secret Word , The Approaching Promise , Masnavi Ravayeh , Whispering Moments , The Fragrance of Sufism , Sufism , Sufism and Peace , Sufism and Knowledge , Sufism and Wisdom , Sufism and Islam , Theory &quot; I &quot; , Sufism the Reality of Religion , Sufism the Bridge between Religions , and Dahm .
Professor Angha &apos;s love , trust , and respect for his son was so great that he spoke of him with unbounded tenderness in his numerous books , including , Serr ##AT##-##AT## ol Hajar , Hamase ##AT##-##AT## ye Hayat , Masnavi Shahed va Mashhood , Seyr ##AT##-##AT## al Sa &apos;er va Teyr al ##AT##-##AT## Nader , Al ##AT##-##AT## Rasa &apos;el , and Principles of Faghr and Sufism .
Absolute , devastating submission of the hearts , is it ?
Still , the celebrated gems of which the legends sing ?
Or is it the surging ocean ?
In the above verse , when mentioning &quot; Molana , &quot; Professor Angha alludes to a poem that Rumi wrote about Hazrat Pir .
In the Sufi tradition , Sufi Masters are known to have the spiritual expansiveness to behold future events even though they may be many centuries ahead .
The love of the beloved , creativity of creation , and enlivener of the soul .
Issued not from the earth , but from the highest heavens .
The stars above question , &quot; what is this brilliant sun ?
The fish in the sea say , &quot; what cataclysmic event is this ?
The lustrous moon ’ s envy is this brilliant sun ’ s light .
The mysterious Mount ’ s summit and most precious , and Nader Angha is he .
This light of vision is the light of Molana ’ s soul .
The might of God and our king , his warrior is he .
Bearer of woes , guardian of tomorrows is he .
What song is this that beckons all hearts ?
I tell you then , the jewel of God ’ s sea is he .
Reference is made to Joseph , the favorite son of Jacob who was thrown in a well by his envious brothers and later sold as a slave to the Egyptians .
Known for his unequalled beauty , he became the symbol of beauty in Sufi literature .

SqlBuilder is a very useful Open Source ( C # ) tool for all developers , which work with databases .
SqlBuilder makes working on SQL servers much easier .
One intention of SqlBuilder is , not to need the primitive and awkward Microsoft SQL tools anymore .
SqlBuilder has a complicated Syntax Parser , which does not only display SQL commands in colors but also automatically converts badly written code into readable code .
Long SQL commands like SELECT are wraped automatically in an intelligent way onto multiple lines and are indented .
The parsing happens during entering text .
Normally you have to pay much money for this functionality .
Additionally SqlBuilder reads automatically stored procedures , views , functions and trigger from the server and allows to edit and store them .
Any SQL command can be executed and the result is displayed as ( a ) table ( s ) .
All procedures , views , functions , triggers and table definitions can be saved in seconds as ##STAR## .SQL files .
huge SQL file for the next release , which is given to the client to execute it to update his server .
A detailed documentation can be found in the download of the sourcecode .
A FTP program for special needs .
Joining splitted archives , download of only a specific part of a file , scheduler , bandwidth control , preview function , and more ...
This program creates PowerPoint presentations fully automated based on XML templates and dynamic data which may come for example from a database .
CabLib is an Open Source library , which allows compressing and extracting files into CAB archives .
CAB archives have a better compression ratio than ZIP archives .
CabLib exists in 2 versions : A code , which can be integrated into C + + programs or as a DLL ( assembly ) , which can be integrated into all .NET projects .
CabLib supports Unicode and encryption of data .
CabLib can directly extract a CAB file from a server - also partial downloads .
This project is based on CabLib : an installer , which installs or updates huge software projects - also per internet , directly from a server .
Additionally it contains an universal Multi ##AT##-##AT## Language class , with which any .NET project easily supports any number of languages .
DHTML Editor is a C + + library for Visual Studio 6 or higher , which integrates Internet Explorer as a control into your application , so that it displays HTML content and allows to edit it .
With this library you can add a comfortable HTML editor to any C + + application , ( like in Outlook Express ) which also allows creating tables .
With this library you can add comfortable callbacks and signals and slots ( = events ) to your C + + application .
Cuttermaran is a program , with which you can cut MPEG video films ( DVB = digital television ) .
If you are new to .NET C # or Visual Basic I recommend to download 101 sample sourcecodes from Microsoft . Even if you are an experienced .NET programmer and want to program something which you never did before ( for example .NET Remoting , Internet Explorer automation , database acces ... ) you find sample code for nearly everything you can do with .NET.
If you want to check your Virus Scanner , you can do that with the encrypted archive AntiVirusChecker.zip.
It contains 75 infected files , which your virus scanner should detect .
If you search for a freeware scanner , I recommend BitDefender version 8 .
Here you find the results of a test with Norton , Bitdefender , AntiVir , Kaspersky , Trendmicro , Norman , Sophos , F ##AT##-##AT## Secure and Avast .
As you see : the perfect virus scanner does not exist !
Generally you should NEVER rely on your virus scanner and combine it with a tool like ProcessGuard ( see below ) , which also protects against very new virus / worms without requiring a database , which must be updated permanently .
As an alternative I recommend VirusTotal where you can upload a suspicious file and VirusTotal checks it with 37 actual virus scanners !
All these programs have one thing in common : they are high quality software and they are easy to use .
Sadly the DiamondCS website is dead .
Runs deep in the operating system and observes all running processes .
Displays all open TCP and UDP ports , packet sniffer , bandwidth throttle , trojan detection .
AutoStartViewer shows , what progs are started when booting ( MUCH more than other tools show !
Detects thousands of Trojans which are not detected by virus scanners , RAT server , keylogger .
Even if your hardddisk is stolen nobody can read your data .
If you &apos;re still wasting your time with the Windows Explorer , you simply don &apos;t know Windows Commander !
The WinCommander joins a File Manager , a FTP client , a packer / unpacker and more in one program .
So it replaces at least Windows Explorer , WinZip and a FTP program .
Context menu ( right mouse button ) of Explorer available .
Opening ZIP , RAR , ARJ , LZH , TAR , GZ , CAB , and ACE and display of the content as a subfolder .
If you are sick of all the security holes and the never ending updates of Internet Explorer and Outlook Express , then I recommend Mozilla Firefox ( browser ) and Mozilla Thunderbird ( email programm ) .
In Thunderbird you have to get used to the different account and folder management .
After importing the Outlook Express addressbook you will note the all subfolders in the addressbook are gone .
( all addresses are in one folder ) The reason for that is not Thunderbird but Microsoft !
There is also a portable version avaible of Thunderbird which runs from memorystick and stores your emails on memorystick .
It loads much faster and without splash screen .
You can make annotations in the PDF document ( e.g. underline text , add your own text , see screenshot ) and save these to disk or print them out .
You may convert the whole PDF document into a simple text file .
Your browser will never again crash or hang while you open a PDF document on a webpage because FoxitReader will always open PDFs in an own process and not in a browser window .
Foxit PDF Creator allows you to convert non ##AT##-##AT## PDF file into PDF file .
Foxit PDF Editor allows you to modify content of a PDF file .
PDF Factory is a Printer Driver , which allows to convert any document ( e.g. from MS Word ) , which is sent to the printer , into a PDF document .
Interesting side effect : If you have a protected PDF document , which does not allow to copy text from it , you only have to &quot; print &quot; this document to PDF Factory and you get the same document but without protection .
ExpressTalk offers telephone conferences , an addressbook , an answering machine , video transfer , recording of calls and a lot more .
More and more providers offer an Internet telephony flatrate . For Germany I recommend Sipgate.de , where you get a real telephone number in the fixed line network .
Obviously calls to other SIP telephones are ALWAYS free , no matter where they are in the world .
If you don &apos;t want to have your PC running all the time just to telephone you can buy the cheap SIP telephone GrandStream BT ##AT##-##AT## 101 ( Screenshot ) which is connected directly with your DSL router or LAN . It can be configured comfortably via web interface .
With the freeware programm PGP 8 you can encrypt emails , files and network connections with up to 2048 bit keys .
You can also create self ##AT##-##AT## extracting encrypted archives ( EXE ) , which will only decrypt after entering the correct passphrase .
An additional feature is PGPdisk , which creates an encrypted drive .
This drive appears as a normal drive with files and folders in it .
But all data in this drive is stored in one single encrypted file .
To open this drive you have to enter the passphrase .
Form version 8 on you can trust PGP again as the source ##AT##-##AT## code is published .
From version 9 on PGP is not freeware anymore , for that you can download version 8 here .
Detailed ( German ) information about PGP available at Kai Raven &apos;s homepage .
You should use words , which don &apos;t exist in dictionaries and use lower case and upper case letters at a wrong position in a word and include numbers . Also you should never write down your passphrase anywhere !
With the freeware program TrueCrpyt you can create encrypted volumes .
These can be based either on a single encrypted file or you can encrypt an entire partition .
After entering the correct passphrase you can read and write the encrypted ( virtual ) volume in exactly the same way as any other ( real ) volume .
If someone steals your harddisk , nobody can read your data .
You can also burn a 4,5 GB encrypted file onto a DVD together with the tiny TrueCrypt program ( 800 kB ) .
Then you can put this DVD into any computer , start TrueCrypt without installation directly from the DVD , enter the passphrase and the content of the DVD will open in a new Windows volume ( e.g. drive M : ) with all its directories and files as you have created it before .
Truecrypt can even encrypt your entire Windows partition while Windows is running !
TrueCrypt offers the same security as PGP .
TeamViewer is a Remote Administration Tool , which allows to connect with another computer ( even PC with MAC ) and remote ##AT##-##AT## control it .
You can also show your desktop to your colleagues in a team session .
The special feature of Teamviewer is , that in contrast to a Windows Remote ##AT##-##AT## Desktop connection it allows to connect via Internet , even if both computers are behind a firewall !
This is possible because Teamviewer connects to a server , which assigns a unique user identifier to each user . Then you give this number to your partner to connect .
You do not need any administrator privileges to run the program , it runs without installation .
Additionally Teamviewer has a file ##AT##-##AT## transfer module and also functions within local networks without internet access .
ACDSee is a Graphic browser , that supports all graphic formats ( also animated graphics ) With the space bar you can jump to the next image on your hard disk / CD .
The program adapts to the size of the image or can be used in fullsreen mode to make a slide show .
The Thumbnail view gives a quick overview about all images in a folder .
If you are looking for a software to not only display the images and videos from your digital camera but also edit and manage them , I recommend the shareware ACDSee version 8 or the Freeware Faststone Image Viewer which shows the fotos also on a beamer .
At Doom9 you find software and guides to ripp DVD &apos;s , convert them to Video CD , AVI , MPEG or DivX , to cut and play films .... etc .

Simply drag and drop the files you want to write to CD / DVD onto the drive in Explorer .
Then you can use the CD / DVD like a movable drive .
InCD will automatically mount each formatted CD / DVD which you put into the drive .
DVD Ram &apos;s can be overwritten 100.000 times ( 100 times as much as CD RW &apos;s ) and are currently available as single sided with 4.7 GB or double sided with 9.4 GB with or without cartridge .
Not all burners support DVD Ram !

Olympus products can be used for a wide variety of thickness measurement , flaw detection , and condition monitoring tests in pipes and tanks .
Thickness gaging and flaw detection can usually be performed from the outside and often at elevated temperature , without requiring draining , disassembly , or process shutdown .
The rugged design of equipment from Olympus allows it to perform in even the toughest environments , providing cost ##AT##-##AT## effective inspection solutions without teardown .
Ultrasonic flaw detectors and phased array systems are widely used for monitoring the integrity of pipes , tanks , heat exchangers , and structural metals throughout the energy and chemical industries , including detection of hydrogen cracking and similar forms of intergranular weakening , and for pipeline weld inspection .
Hand ##AT##-##AT## held ultrasonic thickness gages are widely used for corrosion monitoring .
Eddy current instruments are used in the oil and petrochemical industries primarily for the inspection of in service tubing , including tube bundles that are used for cooling processes .
Often these tube bundles can be several thousand tubes , each of which must be inspected for pitting , cracking , wear , and corrosion , and eddy current makes this a relatively fast process .
Eddy current array technology quickens the process even further .
Eddy current array technologies are also being developed for detecting cracking , particularly chloride stress corrosion cracking .
Videoscopes , fiberscopes and borescopes are used throughout many different types of plant , for instance in condenser tubes , heat exchangers and tubes , pipelines , steam and power turbines , pumps , gearboxes , compressors , boilers , headers and valves .
Olympus RVI equipment can be used for condition monitoring , by means of integral or optional photo ##AT##-##AT## documentation systems , including advanced digital image management software , and by measurement via videoscopes and borescopes , allowing accurate assessment of defect length , width and depth .

In applications such as plastic containers , the operator simply drops the small target ball inside the container .
The magnetic probe held on the outsider of the container attracts the target ball .
When the operator scans the probe along the surface or critical corners , the small steel target ball will follow .
In the Minimum Mode feature , the gage continually displays both the actual thickness and the lowest thickness reading .
The Magna ##AT##-##AT## Mike 8500 is the ideal instrument for measuring difficult shapes and sizes .
Nondestructive measurement capabilities allow for pinpoint thickness readings in tight corners and grooves down to a radius of 1 / 32 &quot; .
The Magna ##AT##-##AT## Mike has been successfully integrated into quality control programs for glass and aluminum containers , aerospace composite parts , medical packaging , automotive panels , airbag tear seams , and other parts made from nonferrous materials .
Industrial XY ( motorized and manual ) and manual weld inspection scanners provide reliable , accurate performance in a wide range of heavy duty industrial applications in which scanners are used to improve quality and reduce costs .

Outputs a large amount of information about the current state of PHP .
This includes information about PHP compilation options and extensions , the PHP version , server information and environment ( if compiled as a module ) , the PHP environment , OS version information , paths , master and local values of configuration options , HTTP headers , and the PHP License .
Because every system is setup differently , phpinfo ( ) is commonly used to check configuration settings and for available predefined variables on a given system .
phpinfo ( ) is also a valuable debugging tool as it contains all EGPCS ( Environment , GET , POST , Cookie , Server ) data .
One can also combine the respective constants or bitwise values together with the or operator .
Loaded modules and their respective settings .
Shows all predefined variables from EGPCS ( Environment , GET , POST , Cookie , Server ) .
The &quot; Loaded Configuration File &quot; information was added , when before only &quot; Configuration File ( php.ini ) Path &quot; existed .
Note : Parts of the information displayed are disabled when the expose ##UNDERSCORE## php configuration setting is set to off .
This includes the PHP and Zend logos , and the credits .
Note : phpinfo ( ) outputs plain text instead of HTML when using the CLI mode .
There are quite a few functions that do not fit into the DOM standard and should no longer be used .
These functions are listed in the following table .
The function DomNode ##UNDERSCORE## append ##UNDERSCORE## child ( ) has changed its behaviour . It now adds a child and not a sibling .
If this breaks your application , use the non ##AT##-##AT## DOM function DomNode ##UNDERSCORE## append ##UNDERSCORE## sibling ( ) .
Create a new node with e.g. DomDocument ##UNDERSCORE## create ##UNDERSCORE## element ( ) and add it with DomNode ##UNDERSCORE## append ##UNDERSCORE## child ( ) .
Create a new node with e.g. DomDocument ##UNDERSCORE## create ##UNDERSCORE## text ##UNDERSCORE## node ( ) and add it with DomNode ##UNDERSCORE## append ##UNDERSCORE## child ( ) .
Content is just a text node and can be accessed with DomNode ##UNDERSCORE## child ##UNDERSCORE## nodes ( ) .
Content is just a text node and can be added with DomNode ##UNDERSCORE## append ##UNDERSCORE## child ( ) .
The API of the module follows the DOM Level 2 standard as closely as possible .
It is a good idea to have the DOM standard available when using this module .
Though the API is object ##AT##-##AT## oriented , there are many functions which can be called in a non ##AT##-##AT## object ##AT##-##AT## oriented way by passing the object to operate on as the first argument .
These functions are mainly to retain compatibility to older versions of the extension , and should not be used when creating new scripts .
This API differs from the official DOM API in two ways .
First , all class attributes are implemented as functions with the same name .
Secondly , the function names follow the PHP naming convention .
This means that a DOM function lastChild ( ) will be written as last ##UNDERSCORE## child ( ) .
This module defines a number of classes , which are listed - including their method - in the following tables .
Classes with an equivalent in the DOM standard are named DOMxxx .
This function emulates the former behaviour of DomNode ##UNDERSCORE## append ##UNDERSCORE## child ( ) .
Many examples in this reference require an XML string .
Instead of repeating this string in every example , it will be put into a file which will be included by each example .
This include file is shown in the following example section .
Alternatively , you could create an XML document and read it with DomDocument ##UNDERSCORE## open ##UNDERSCORE## file ( ) .
even the SimpleXML functions are object ##AT##-##AT## oriented , which doesn &apos;t work for some of my purposes ( sending to a Smarty template variable for looping through , etc . ) -- returning attributes as SimpleXMLElement objects instead of strings , etc .. i just wanted an ARRAY containing the data as STRINGS .

Hotblooded Pakistani Raqia Khan &amp; the psychopathic rap ##AT##-##AT## crooner Splatterdandy sing about fake compliments and greetings from the universe , about perfect romance and gas intoxication , about porno , politics and power .
Even the German Bundeskanzlerin Angela Merkel becomes dancable : The new German national anthem &quot; Hart Durchregieren &quot; ( which means as much as &quot; Rule Hard &quot; ) , where Khan performs as a Russian domina , takes up a demand of Angela Merkel , while &quot; Unterschicht &quot; dismantles a decade of political reforms with sex in a social welfare center .
Thus they bring porno into politics , politics back into porn and intelligent statements back into the underground .
In explicit openness they sing about Berlin , a city , which is built on blood , about meetings with zombies and strange orgies .
The sound is hard , sensitive and dancable , mixing seventies disco , US ##AT##-##AT## west ##AT##-##AT## coast rap , house , soul and dirty funk .

The record is for the most dominoes toppled in a chain reaction .
The pushover must start from a single point . Once the chain reaction ends , the attempt is over .
It is not important how many dominoes were set up - just the number of dominoes which fall counts .
On 17 January 2004 , at the opening of the Weser tunnel in Germany , a brick toppling record was set when approximately 1,500 volunteers built a line of bricks ( weighing 2 kg each ) from Bremerhaven to Nordenham , a distance of almost 27 km &#91; 16.78 miles &#93; .
Starting in Atlanta , the chain reaction continued through Rio de Janeiro , London , Nairobi , Tokyo , Sydney , finishing back in Atlanta .
The first domino at each site was triggered by an electronic signal relayed from a switch activated by the last domino at the prior site . Team members : John Wickham , Scott Suko , Michael Cairney , Erez Klein , Akira Enomoto , Daniel Beckerleg .
In the keynote address by the EPA , they announced that there was an epidemic of multiple sclerosis and systemic lupus , and they did not understand what toxin was causing this to be rampant across the United States . I explained I was there to lecture on exactly that subject .
When the temperature of Aspartame exceeds 86 degrees F , the wood alcohol in ASPARTAME coverts to formaldehyde and then to formic acid , which in turn causes metabolic acidosis . ( Formic acid is the poison found in the sting of fire ants .
) The methanol toxicity mimics multiple sclerosis ; thus , people were being diagnosed with having multiple sclerosis in error . The multiple sclerosis is not a death sentence , where methanol toxicity is .
In the cases of systemic lupus , which is triggered by ASPARTAME , the victim usually does not know that the aspartame is the culprit . The victim continues its use aggravating the lupus to such a degree , that sometimes it becomes life threatening .
During a visit to a hospice , a nurse said that six of her friends , who were heavy Diet Coke drinkers , had all been diagnosed with MS. This is beyond coincidence .
Now there are over 5,000 products containing this chemical , and the PATENT HAS EXPIRED ! ! ! !
Formaldehyde is grouped in the same class of drugs as cyanide and arsenic - DEADLY POISONS ! ! ! Unfortunately , it just takes longer to quietly kill , but it is killing people and causing all kinds of neurological problems .
The Congressional record said , &quot; It makes you crave Carbohydrates and will make you FAT . &quot; Dr. Roberts stated that when he got patients off aspartame , their average weight loss was 19 pounds per person .
We find that physicians believe that they have patients with retinopathy , when in fact , it is caused by the aspartame . The aspartame keeps the blood sugar level out of control , causing many patients to go into a coma .
People were telling us at the conference of the American College of Physicians , that they had relatives that switched from saccharin to an aspartame product and how that relative had eventually gone into a coma .
Their physicians could not get the blood sugar levels under control .
Dr. Blaylock has written a book entitled &quot; EXCITOTOXINS : THE TASTE THAT KILLS &quot; Health Press 1 ##AT##-##AT## 800 ##AT##-##AT## 643 ##AT##-##AT## 2665 ) . Dr. H. J. Roberts , diabetic specialist and world expert on aspartame poisoning , has also written a book entitled &quot; DEFENSE AGAINST ALZHEIMER &apos;S DISEASE &quot; ( 1 ##AT##-##AT## 800 ##AT##-##AT## 814 ##AT##-##AT## 9800 ) .
He said , &quot; His diabetic patients presented memory loss , confusion , and severe vision loss . &quot; At the Conference of the American College of Physicians , doctors admitted that they did not know .
This &quot; poison &quot; is now available in 90 PLUS countries worldwide .
Take the &quot; NO ASPARTAME TEST &quot; and send us your case history . I assure you that MONSANTO , the creator of Aspart ame , knows how deadly it is .
The New York Times , November 15 , 1996 , ran an article on how the American Dietetic Association takes money from the food industry to endorse their products .
Therefore , they cannot criticize any additives or tell about their link to MONSANTO .
The child was having grand mal seizures every day . The mother called her physician , who called the ADA , who told the doctor not to take the child off the NutraSweet .
We are still trying to convince the mother that the Aspartame is causing the seizures . Every time we get someone off of aspartame , the seizures stop .
Aspartame Disease is partially the cause to what is behind some of the mystery of the Desert Storm health problems . The burning tongue and other problems discussed in over 60 cases can be directly related to the consumption of Aspartame product .
Several thousand pallets of diet drinks were shipped to the Desert Storm troops . ( Remember heat can liberate the methanol from the aspartame at 86 degrees F. ) Diet drinks sat in the 120 degree F Arabian sun for weeks at a time on pallets The servicemen and women drank them all day long .
There are a lot of people out there who must be warned , please let them know this information .

Emily Grose , daughter of Canadian Rotarian Ed Grose , befriended other children while accompanying her parents on a Rotary ##AT##-##AT## related trip to Uganda in 2004 .
The trip inspired a Matching Grant project that Grose is coordinating for his club .
One of the most sobering facts about malaria is that it can be prevented simply by sleeping under an insecticide ##AT##-##AT## treated mosquito net .
These nets can last five years and cost about US $ 10 -- expensive to families who survive on less than $ 1 a day but , thanks to Rotarian efforts , now accessible to many of them .
The Rotary Club of Kråkerøy , Norway , teamed up with the Rotary Club of Machakos , Kenya , in 2004 on a $ 16,000 Matching Grant project to distribute 3,000 mosquito nets to children under five and pregnant women in a slum of Machakos and nearby rural villages .
Malaria prevention often fits in with larger community development ventures .

The challenges for mobility are growing constantly .
The concentration of an increasingly older world population in urban areas , which are growing at an ever faster pace , poses a tremendous challenge for mobility in the future .
More than ever before , the quality of life and competitiveness of whole regions will depend upon safe and fast public transportation .
Only a service provider who can focus on everything – from infrastructure to vehicles , from planning to after ##AT##-##AT## sales service – can provide the answer to this challenge : namely , through the sensible coordination of all modes of transportation , tailored to specific mobility requirements .
Where required , as a complete and ready ##AT##-##AT## made solution from a single source .
Come aboard and enjoy the world of Complete mobility .
Perfect solutions are distinguished by their broad focus .
Swiftly traveling across country to destination .
Taking time out for oneself or someone else .
Arrive at their destinations refreshed and relaxed ?
Even on longer journeys , time flies by with Desiro ML .
Everyone glides along smoothly without turbulence thanks to the air ##AT##-##AT## sprung bogies and comfortable seats adapted for long distances .
Combining ultramodern technology with service ##AT##-##AT## proven equipment and designed to meet the requirements of existing and future norms , the Desiro ML platform is setting new standards in modern rail ##AT##-##AT## based transportation .
Standards typified by low ##AT##-##AT## floor seating arrangements , generously apportioned doorways and gangways , an attractive , innovative design , and maximum passenger comfort .
In every aspect of its design , equipment and modular interior , the Desiro ML goes one step further with the level comfort .
Innovative , variable solutions for passengers and driver not only meet but exceed expectations for an attractive mass transit system .
Journeys are so pleasurable that by the time they leave the train , passengers will be already looking forward to their next ride on the Desiro ML .
The profitability of a transportation system is a lot more than simply looking at the costs of purchase and operation .
Here again , the temporarily coupled unit concept of the Desiro ML has the edge on permanently coupled trains .
And that starts with its higher capacity : its longer car length gives a 3 ##AT##-##AT## car Desiro ML more seats than an articulated train of the same length with the same seat spacing .
When you go on a journey , you want to reach your destination safely .
Commuter , regional and InterRegio services with passenger appeal are closely associated with relaxation and feeling safe .
That ’ s why safety is an integral part of the Desiro ML train concept .
It offers responsible interaction with our environment and reassurance for the operators that statutory regulations will be met now and in the future .
Are you looking for a partner who will guide you , reliably and competently , every step of the way , from your first decision to buy , through the planning stage , to a complete aftersales service ?
Over the last 160 years , Siemens has established a proven track record in project management .
The vast knowledge acquired by the company over this time has been used to advantage for the Desiro ML .
Manufacturers and operators of rail ##AT##-##AT## based transportation systems face two new trends : shorter lead times and rising cost pressure .
This has a knock ##AT##-##AT## on effect on inspection and testing , for new rail systems have to be operationally ready and reliable from day one .

On the Canaries , the islands themselves are the greatest treasure .
So close to each other and yet so different , they all boast the most incredible landscapes so the visitor can explore all the facets of an amazing and fanciful natural world .
Here you will find a unique rural setting where you will encounter volcanoes with magical landscapes created by lava , untamed woodlands , pinewoods , immense expanses of dunes , coastlines and mountainous areas , in spaces that are protected because of their rich bio ##AT##-##AT## diversity and their numerous indigenous species which include dragon trees , junipers and viper &apos;s bugloss .
Rural tourism on the islands is a unique experience .
You can stay at houses that conserve all the flavour of days gone by or in small , friendly hotels with a family atmosphere ; in the mountains or in picturesque villages where hospitality is a tradition ; near the sea or in the silence of the countryside - it is up to you .
The gentle temperatures of the islands enable you to enjoy all the open ##AT##-##AT## air leisure options 365 days a year : you can follow the footpaths on foot , on horseback or riding a camel , make a bicycle tour or go canyoning down the ravines that are brimming with vegetation ; or explore the mysteries of the volcanic tubes , climb incredible walls of rock or dive in the crystal ##AT##-##AT## clear waters and find yourself surrounded by rays and amberjacks .
From the air , the Canary Islands are just as spectacular . There is nothing better than to para ##AT##-##AT## glide over the mountains and beaches in order to absorb all their beauty .
The Canary Islands are part of the region of Macaronesia , one of the most important in the world for their rich bio ##AT##-##AT## diversity . Exclusive to this region is laurisilva , a virgin laurel woodland which once covered the entire Mediterranean basin and which has its last redoubt here .
The Canaries have 141 protected areas , four of which are are National Parks .
There are four Biosphere Reserves and a total of 1,386 native plants , 546 of which are peculiar to these Islands .
The clarity of the sky and limited light contamination have led to the installation of two international astronomical observatories from which , among others , significant solar studies are carried out .
The Archipelago has hundreds of volcanoes and a rich variety of ecosystems and microclimates , which enable certain protected animals to survive such as the white ##AT##-##AT## tailed and Bolle &apos;s laurel pigeons , the Canarian lizard known as the tizón , the blue chaffinch and the osprey .

Test specifications for the CANoe test execution machine can be programmed in a simple programming language ( CAPL ) specially tailored for testing distributed systems , or they can be defined in an XML language .
The structure of the test specification is identical in both cases .
The stimulation and evaluation of events needed to test ECU functionality are encapsulated in test cases .
The overall test specification is referred to as a test module .
On the test module , test groups or test cases level additional conditions can be formulated ( Invariants ) .
These conditions are evaluated in the particular context in parallel to the actual test execution .
The supplemental test and stimulus functions contained in the Test Service Library ( TSL ) simplify setup and execution of your own test scenarios . Besides supporting automated tests , CANoe also supports manual execution of test cases , e.g.

Cyclomatic complexity ( also referred as program complexity or McCabe ´ s complexity ) is the most widely used member of a class of static software metrics .
It may be considered a broad measure of soundness and confidence for a program .
The cyclomatic complexity has been introduced by Thomas McCabe in 1976 .
It measures the number of linearly ##AT##-##AT## independent paths through a program module .
The McCabe complexity is one of the more widely ##AT##-##AT## accepted software metrics , it is intended to be independent of language and language format .
McCabe &apos;s Cyclomatic number v ( G ) shows the complexity of the flow of control through a piece of code .
v ( G ) is the number of conditional branches in the flowchart .
v ( G ) = 1 for a program consisting of only sequential statements .
For a single function ; v ( G ) is one less than the number of conditional branching points in the function .
The greater the cyclomatic number is the more execution paths there are through the function , and the harder it is to understand .
Note , that the cyclomatic number is insensitive to the complexity of data structures , data flows , and module interfaces .
When dynamic testing is concerned , the cyclomatic number v ( G ) is one of the most important complexity measures .
Because the cyclomatic number describes the control flow complexity , it is obvious that modules and functions having high cyclomatic number need more test cases than modules having a lower cyclomatic number .
As a rule of thumb , each function should have at least as many test cases as indicated by its cyclomatic number .
The cyclomatic number of a function should be less than 15 .
If a function has a cyclomatic number of 15 , there are at least 15 ( but probably more ) execution paths through it .
More than 15 paths are hard to identify and test .
Functions containing one selection statement with many branches make up an exception .
A reasonable upper limit Cyclomatic number of a file is 100 .
McCabe Cyclomatic number v ( G ) is calculated on ( member ) function definitions and on class / struct declarations . It is also calculated on the entire source file .
Each if ##AT##-##AT## statement introduces a new branch to the program and therefore increases v ( G ) by one .
Iteration constructs such as for- and while ##AT##-##AT## loops also introduce branches .
Each case ... : part in the switch ##AT##-##AT## statement increase the v ( G ) by one .
Case branch does not increase v ( G ) , because it does not increase the number of branches in the control flow .
If there are two or more case ... : parts that have no code in between , the McCabe measure is increased only with one for all those case ... : parts .
Each catch ( ... ) part in a try ##AT##-##AT## block increases v ( G ) by one .
It should be noted that v ( G ) is insensitive to unconditional branches like goto- , return- and break ##AT##-##AT## statements although they surely increase complexity .
In CMT + + the branches generated by conditional compilation directives are also counted to v ( G ) .
Even if conditional compilation directives do not add branches to the control flow of the executable program , they increase the complexity of the program file that the user sees and edits .
In summary , the following language constructs increase the cyclomatic number by one : if ( ... ) , for ( ... ) , while ( ... ) , case ... : , catch ( ... ) , &amp; &amp; , &#124; &#124; , ? , # if , # ifdef , # ifndef , # elif .

PHP provides a large number of predefined variables to all scripts .
The variables represent everything from external variables to built ##AT##-##AT## in environment variables , last error messages to last retrieved headers .
See also the FAQ titled &quot; How does register ##UNDERSCORE## globals affect me ?
header ( ) is used to send a raw HTTP header .
See the » HTTP / 1.1 specification for more information on HTTP headers .
Remember that header ( ) must be called before any actual output is sent , either by normal HTML tags , blank lines in a file , or from PHP .
It is a very common error to read code with include ( ) , or require ( ) , functions , or another file access function , and have spaces or empty lines that are output before header ( ) is called .
The same problem exists when using a single PHP / HTML file .
The first is a header that starts with the string &quot; HTTP / &quot; ( case is not significant ) , which will be used to figure out the HTTP status code to send .
For example , if you have configured Apache to use a PHP script to handle requests for missing files ( using the ErrorDocument directive ) , you may want to make sure that your script generates the proper status code .
The second special case is the &quot; Location : &quot; header .
Not only does it send this header back to the browser , but it also returns a REDIRECT ( 302 ) status code to the browser unless some 3xx status code has already been set .
parameter indicates whether the header should replace a previous similar header , or add a second header of the same type .
as the second argument you can force multiple headers of the same type .
This function now prevents more than one header to be sent at once as a protection against header injection attacks .
If you want the user to be prompted to save the data you are sending , such as a generated PDF file , you can use the » Content ##AT##-##AT## Disposition header to supply a recommended filename and force the browser to display the save dialog .
PHP scripts often generate dynamic content that must not be cached by the client browser or any proxy caches between the server and the client browser .
Note : You may find that your pages aren &apos;t cached even if you don &apos;t output all of the headers above .
There are a number of options that users may be able to set for their browser that change its default caching behavior .
By sending the headers above , you should override any settings that may otherwise cause the output of your script to be cached .
Additionally , session ##UNDERSCORE## cache ##UNDERSCORE## limiter ( ) and the session.cache ##UNDERSCORE## limiter configuration setting can be used to automatically generate the correct caching ##AT##-##AT## related headers when sessions are being used .
Note : As of PHP 4 , you can use output buffering to get around this problem , with the overhead of all of your output to the browser being buffered in the server until you send it .
Note : The HTTP status header line will always be the first sent to the client , regardless of the actual header ( ) call being the first or not .
The status may be overridden by calling header ( ) with a new status line at any time unless the HTTP headers have already been sent .
Note : There is a bug in Microsoft Internet Explorer 4.01 that prevents this from working . There is no workaround .
There is also a bug in Microsoft Internet Explorer 5.5 that interferes with this , which can be resolved by upgrading to Service Pack 2 or later .
Note : If safe mode is enabled the uid of the script is added to the realm part of the WWW ##AT##-##AT## Authenticate header if you set this header ( used for HTTP Authentication ) .
Note : HTTP / 1.1 requires an absolute URI as argument to » Location : including the scheme , hostname and absolute path , but some clients accept relative URIs .
Note : Session ID is not passed with Location header even if session.use ##UNDERSCORE## trans ##UNDERSCORE## sid is enabled .

Deadlocks are a classic problem in transactional databases , but they are not dangerous unless they are so frequent that you cannot run certain transactions at all .
Normally , you must write your applications so that they are always prepared to re ##AT##-##AT## issue a transaction if it gets rolled back because of a deadlock .
You can get deadlocks even in the case of transactions that just insert or delete a single row .
That is because these operations are not really “ atomic ” ; they automatically set locks on the ( possibly several ) index records of the row inserted or deleted .
to determine the cause of the latest deadlock .
That can help you to tune your application to avoid deadlocks .
Always be prepared to re ##AT##-##AT## issue a transaction if it fails due to deadlock .
Small transactions are less prone to collision .
Access your tables and rows in a fixed order .
Then transactions form well ##AT##-##AT## defined queues and do not deadlock .
Then your queries need to scan fewer index records and consequently set fewer locks .
to determine which indexes the MySQL server regards as the most appropriate for your queries .
isolation level is good here , because each consistent read within the same transaction reads from its own fresh snapshot .
If nothing else helps , serialize your transactions with table ##AT##-##AT## level locks .

Software is codified power in the digital domain .
In other words -- to quote Stanford Professor Lawrence Lessig -- Code is a regulator that governs cyberspace in ways similar to Law governing the real world .
In the Northern world , most people are already depending upon software for very basic tasks of communication , education and work .
The grade of dependency is generally lower in the Southern world today .
But if the digital literacy and inclusion projects show the intended effect , the dependency will be as high , potentially even higher , as many areas aim to skip the intermediate steps of analog infrastructure and directly enter the digital world .
Much of this interaction with and dependency upon software remains unreflected and in fact unnoticed -- fulfilling a prediction that Professor Weizenbaum of MIT made many years ago . Unless sitting in front of a physical machine explicitly marked as &quot; Computer &quot; , the majority of users will often remain unaware of using software .
A common example for this are mobile phones .
With the trend towards ambient computing , this effect is likely to increase .
While access to software determines our ability to participate in a digital society and governs our ability for communication , education and work , software itself represents a reservoir of codified skill .
Software allows humankind to collectively refine and exercise sets of codified skills that most of the individuals do not possess .
An example are graphical applications , which in the scope of complex image editing make complex mathematical transformations like Fast Fourier Transformation ( FFT ) available to everyone capable of understanding the applications &apos; menu symbols .
While the issues of software are centrally connected to many of the issues discussed during the World Summit on the Information Society , the lack of awareness on all sides for software as the cultural technique of the digital age often complicated the situation .
While most governments often see software from a purely economic perspective , some large industrial players have begun understanding the amount of political power embedded in it .
By propertizing the software , they gain almost absolute control over the users -- be they private people , other companies or governments -- and the rules these have to obey .
Proprietary software always remains under control of the licensor of the software , not the user .
And in a networked world , that control can even be remotely exercised -- independent of whether the user of the software is an individual or a government .
That dependency on proprietary software is infectious .
Protocols are kept secret , standards are being broken .
These protocols are not secret because they are valuable , they draw their value from being secret .
The company Microsoft poses a very good example for both cases , as the European Commission antitrust case and the modification of the Kerberos standard have shown .
The countermodel to proprietary software is based on breaking that dependency and putting an equal amount of power into the hands of all people .
It is defined by four fundamental freedoms : the freedom of unlimited use for any purpose , the freedom to study , the freedom to modify and the freedom to distribute the software both in original and modified form .
The original name for this model is Free Software .
It is sometimes also referred to as &quot; Open Source &quot; , a marketing synonym proposed in 1998 to attract venture capital that is frequently abused these days to sell proprietary software under the guise of Free Software .
Other synonyms frequently encountered are &quot; FOSS &quot; -- for &quot; Free and Open Source Software &quot; -- and &quot; FLOSS &quot; -- for &quot; Free , Libre and Open Source Software &quot; -- which , besides being redundant terms , seek to spread the ideology that software should not be seen as a political issue .
As all these are synonyms and in the interest of clarity , this paper is using the original term , Free Software .
The Free Software groups became truly involved in the WSIS during the Intersessional Meeting in Paris in July 2003 .
At this point , the proprietary software advocates had almost succeeded in eliminating the political issues around software from the documents by portraying them as a purely technical choice of software development .
Within Civil Society , software issues were part of the Patents , Copyrights and Trademarks ( PCT ) Working Group , which centrally dealt with all issues around intellectual poverty as well as equal and inclusive access to software , the digital cultural technique .
In a concerted effort between the PCT working group and a handful of governments , most notably Brazil , it was possible to put an end to further erosion of software issues from the documents and revert the trend .
This positive trend continued in the following Preparatory Committee Conferences , during which Free Software and Patents , Copyrights and Trademarks ( PCT ) were among the most controversial issues .
&quot; Software is the medium of and structuring entity for the digital domain .
The information age will rest upon it .
Having been denounced as a technical development model , Free Software is much more than that .
It is a paradigm that secures equal chances and freedom for governments , economy and civil society alike .
It provides a truly sustainable model for all areas of society , bringing back competition and furthering innovation for a prosperous and inclusive information and knowledge society for all .
&quot; Software is the cultural technique of the digital age and access to it determines who may participate in a digital world .
Free Software with its freedoms of use for any purpose , studying , modification and redistribution is an essential building block for an empowering , sustainable and inclusive information society .
No software model should be forbidden or negatively regulated , but Free Software should be promoted for its unique social , educational , scientific , political and economic benefits and opportunities .
Despite the massive presence of proprietary software support from both industry and several governments , in particular the United States and several European Union states , such as the UK , this made it impossible to deny the political consequences and impact of software .
Free Software gained much political visibility during WSIS , but while Civil Society has adopted it widely as a principle , many organisations still use proprietary software themselves .
The effect of this practice on developing countries has never been subject of deep research , but seeral consequences are to be expected .
The psychological damage of organisations telling others to follow policies that they ignore themselves can be considerable .
Especially in Southern countries , this can easily create the impression of a policy trying to satisfy people with breadcrumbs while keeping the more valuable things to themselves .
That would be tragic , as the opposite is indeed true .
More severely , by showing to use proprietary software themselves or even advocating use of proprietary software in Southern countries , organisations can involuntarily destroy the effect of their work .
While trying to rid Southern countries from dependency on the North and strengthening democracy , they do the opposite .
To gain a seeming short ##AT##-##AT## term improvement of the situation , they create strong mid ##AT##-##AT## term dependencies for participation in the Information Society .
That is why Sergio Amadeu da Silveira , president of the National Information Technology Institute ( ITI ) in Brasil likened the proprietary software model to that of drug dealers -- the first shot is gratis .
So while much progress has been made , there is still need for further development on all sides : Governments , Industry and Civil Society .
As is already inherent in the Declaration of Principles and the Plan of Action , all sides will need to develop a practice of evaluating the political , social and economic side of software along with its technological capabilities .
To uphold their political independence and democratic basis , Governments will need to make deliberate efforts to further economic and social empowerment based on commercial and non ##AT##-##AT## commercial Free Software .
To protect their commercial interests , Industry based on and active in Free Software will need to provide a counterweight to proprietary software voices .
And to maintain its credibility , Civil Society will need to consistently use Free Software as well as advocate it .

The upgrade scenarios from an existing WB version to a newer one is explained in more detail here .
Question : Can HTML , Javascript und PHP statements be mixed ?
However , Javascript and PHP statements will only be parsed when invoked from a pages or sections of type : Code .
It is not possible to put working PHP or Javascript statements to a WYSIWYG page or section ( you can add it , but the statements will not be executed ! ! !
You have to use the echo or print commands of PHP , when using Javascript and HTML statements within a page or section of type code ( page type code is made for parsing PHP ) .
You need to escape all special characters by yourself .
Best way of mixing HTML code with Javascript statements is to use the PHP Heredoc Syntax ( consult the PHP manual for details ) .
Copy the following code into a page / section of type code and view the results .
Question : Mails sent via the Form module do not show up - why ?
If you have specified a valid recipient address but emails do not show up , please read this Knowledge base article .
Question : What is the WB IRC chat ?
IRC ( Internet Relay Chat ) is a form of real ##AT##-##AT## time Internet chat or synchronous conferencing .
It is mainly designed for group ( many ##AT##-##AT## to ##AT##-##AT## many ) communication in discussion forums called channels , but also allows one ##AT##-##AT## to ##AT##-##AT## one communication and data transfers via private message .
Website Baker has a permanent channel at freenode.net , thanks to tomhung !
You first must have an IRC Client .
If you use Opera , you already have a built ##AT##-##AT## in client , for Firefox there &apos;s the Add ##AT##-##AT## on ChatZilla .
If you don &apos;t like them or use another browser you could either use the &quot; all ##AT##-##AT## in ##AT##-##AT## one &quot; instant message clients Miranda IM or Trilian , or pure IRC clients like X ##AT##-##AT## chat or the ( not free but &quot; everybody has &quot; ) mIRC .
Look at wikipedia - there are many comparison sheets if you are unsure which of them fits your needs .
Well - why do I have to get there ?
You can easily chat with other WB users , get in contact with the developers , and the Website Baker teams also have meetings there .
But don &apos;t expect hundreds of skilled WB users waiting to solve your problems - the chat is only an additional part for making organisation and user contacts more efficient .
Please don &apos;t think &quot; Oh , there &apos;s another user , perhaps he can solve all my problems &quot; and then posting questions like &quot; WB isn &apos;t working - I give you admin rights , could you get it going ?
&quot; or &quot; I saw somewhere a nice template , please do it now for me , I need it tomorrow and if I don &apos;t get it I will cry all day .
&quot; Website Baker is OpenSource- nobody here on websitebaker.org and in the chat gets any money for helping other WB users and many people put a big amount of time in that .

The board 7317 is used to supply substations or individual radio controlled clock boards with a DCF77 ##AT##-##AT## antenna signal .
On the 7001 data bus there is a simulated DCF77 ##AT##-##AT## pulse as well as a square frequency of 77.5 kHz .
The board creates a DCF77 ##AT##-##AT## antenna signal from this information and leads it to 4 potential free output amplifiers .
In case of a failure of the original DCF77 ##AT##-##AT## signal , the output of the simulated signal is kept up .
Therefore all connected radio controlled clocks or systems do not drift apart but run synchronously .

We &apos;re going mobile mad this June at Casino Tropez and sharing our love of mobile gambling with you .
We &apos;ll give you the lowdown on how to start playing through your mobile phone , along with some fun mobile trivia and details on our special Mobile Day promotion .
FAQ : How do I know if my mobile phone is compatible with Casino Tropez Mobile ?
One of the most popular games to play through your mobile handset is the old classic favourite - Blackjack .
Simply get a card total closer to 21 than the dealer &apos;s cards , without exceeding 21 to win .
In Blackjack , aces count as either 1 or 11 , face cards as 10 , and number cards at their face value .
If you receive an ace and a ten ##AT##-##AT## value card as your first two cards , you have Blackjack and have already won !
When the total value of your cards is closer to 21 than the dealer &apos;s , you also win , but if the total of your cards is more than 21 , you &apos;re &quot; bust &quot; and lose your bet .
If you and the dealer have the same card total ( 17 and up ) both of you lose and your bet is returned to you .
Blackjack ( specifically an ace and a jack of spades or clubs ) beats a regular score of 21 .
It &apos;s similar to spending cash in the real world : It requires no registration , and the player &apos;s financial information is completely secure .
You can purchase Ukash in local stores ( at PayPoint locations nationwide ) , using real money and can spend Ukash wherever the Ukash logo is displayed .
In addition to the monetary value Ukash vouchers also display a unique 19 ##AT##-##AT## digit number which is valid for six months from the purchase .
Simply purchase your Ukash voucher at any of the participating retail outlets and enter the Voucher 19 ##AT##-##AT## digit number in the casino cashier .
The maximum for an individual Ukash transaction is £ 100 / € 150 .
You can purchase up to 5 vouchers at one time .

1 Now the Lord God caused the a famine to wax sore in the land of Ur , insomuch that b Haran , my brother , died ; but c Terah , my father , yet lived in the land of Ur , of the Chaldees .
2 And it came to pass that I , Abraham , took a Sarai to wife , and b Nahor , my brother , took Milcah to wife , who was the c daughter of Haran .
3 Now the Lord had a said unto me : Abraham , get thee out of thy country , and from thy kindred , and from thy father ’ s house , unto a land that I will show thee .
4 Therefore I left the land of a Ur , of the Chaldees , to go into the land of Canaan ; and I took Lot , my brother ’ s son , and his wife , and Sarai my wife ; and also my b father followed after me , unto the land which we denominated Haran .
5 And the famine abated ; and my father tarried in Haran and dwelt there , as there were many flocks in Haran ; and my father turned again unto his a idolatry , therefore he continued in Haran .
6 But I , Abraham , and Lot , my brother ’ s son , prayed unto the Lord , and the Lord a appeared unto me , and said unto me : Arise , and take Lot with thee ; for I have purposed to take thee away out of Haran , and to make of thee a b minister to bear my c name in a strange d land which I will give unto thy seed after thee for an everlasting possession , when they hearken to my voice .
7 For I am the Lord thy God ; I dwell in a heaven ; the earth is my b footstool ; I stretch my hand over the sea , and it obeys my voice ; I cause the wind and the fire to be my c chariot ; I say to the mountains — Depart hence — and behold , they are taken away by a whirlwind , in an instant , suddenly .
8 My a name is Jehovah , and I b know the end from the beginning ; therefore my hand shall be over thee .
13 Thou didst send thine angel to a deliver me from the gods of Elkenah , and I will do well to hearken unto thy voice , therefore let thy servant rise up and depart in peace .
14 So I , Abraham , departed as the Lord had said unto me , and Lot with me ; and I , Abraham , was a sixty and two years old when I departed out of Haran .
16 Therefore , a eternity was our covering and our b rock and our salvation , as we journeyed from Haran by the way of c Jershon , to come to the land of Canaan .
17 Now I , Abraham , built an a altar in the land of Jershon , and made an offering unto the Lord , and prayed that the b famine might be turned away from my father ’ s house , that they might not perish .
18 And then we passed from Jershon through the land unto the place of Sechem ; it was situated in the plains of Moreh , and we had already come into the borders of the land of the a Canaanites , and I offered b sacrifice there in the plains of Moreh , and called on the Lord devoutly , because we had already come into the land of this idolatrous nation .
19 And the Lord a appeared unto me in answer to my prayers , and said unto me : Unto thy seed will I give this b land .
20 And I , Abraham , arose from the place of the altar which I had built unto the Lord , and removed from thence unto a mountain on the east of a Bethel , and pitched my tent there , Bethel on the west , and b Hai on the east ; and there I built another c altar unto the Lord , and d called again upon the name of the Lord .
21 And I , Abraham , journeyed , going on still towards the south ; and there was a continuation of a famine in the land ; and I , Abraham , concluded to go down into Egypt , to sojourn there , for the famine became very grievous .
24 Let her say unto the Egyptians , she is thy sister , and thy soul shall live .
25 And it came to pass that I , Abraham , told Sarai , my wife , all that the Lord had said unto me — Therefore say unto them , I pray thee , thou art my a sister , that it may be well with me for thy sake , and my soul shall live because of thee .
Visions manifested to Joseph Smith the Prophet and Oliver Cowdery in the temple at Kirtland , Ohio , April 3 , 1836 . HC 2 : 435 – 436 .
The Prophet prefaces his record of the manifestations with these words : “ In the afternoon , I assisted the other Presidents in distributing the Lord ’ s Supper to the Church , receiving it from the Twelve , whose privilege it was to officiate at the sacred desk this day .
After having performed this service to my brethren , I retired to the pulpit , the veils being dropped , and bowed myself , with Oliver Cowdery , in solemn and silent prayer .
1 – 10 , The Lord Jehovah appears in glory and accepts the Kirtland Temple as his house ; 11 – 12 , Moses and Elias each appear and commit their keys and dispensations ; 13 – 16 , Elijah returns and commits the keys of his dispensation as promised by Malachi .
1 The a veil was taken from our minds , and the b eyes of our c understanding were opened .
2 We a saw the Lord b standing upon the breastwork of the pulpit , before us ; and under his feet was a paved work of pure c gold , in color like amber .
4 I am the a first and the last ; I am he who b liveth , I am he who was slain ; I am your c advocate with the Father .
5 Behold , your sins are a forgiven you ; you are clean before me ; therefore , lift up your heads and b rejoice .
6 Let the hearts of your brethren rejoice , and let the hearts of all my people rejoice , who have , with their might , a built this house to my name .
7 For behold , I have a accepted this b house , and my name shall be here ; and I will c manifest myself to my people in mercy in this house .
8 Yea , I will a appear unto my servants , and speak unto them with mine own voice , if my people will keep my commandments , and do not b pollute this c holy house .
9 Yea the hearts of thousands and tens of thousands shall greatly rejoice in consequence of the a blessings which shall be poured out , and the b endowment with which my servants have been endowed in this house .
10 And the fame of this house shall spread to foreign lands ; and this is the beginning of the blessing which shall be a poured out upon the heads of my people .
11 After this a vision closed , the heavens were again b opened unto us ; and c Moses appeared before us , and committed unto us the d keys of the e gathering of Israel from the four parts of the earth , and the leading of the ten tribes from the land of the f north .
12 After this , a Elias appeared , and committed the b dispensation of the c gospel of Abraham , saying that in us and our seed all d generations after us should be e blessed .
16 Therefore , the a keys of this b dispensation are committed into your hands ; and by this ye may know that the great and dreadful c day of the Lord is near , even at the doors .
Revelation given to Joseph Smith the Prophet , at Nauvoo , Illinois , January 19 , 1841 . HC 4 : 274 – 286 .
Because of increasing persecutions and illegal procedures against them by public officers , the saints had been compelled to leave Missouri .
The exterminating order issued by Lilburn W. Boggs , Governor of Missouri , dated October 27 , 1838 , had left them no alternative . See HC 3 : 175 .
In 1841 , when this revelation was given , the city of Nauvoo , occupying the site of the former village of Commerce , Illinois , had been built up by the saints , and here the headquarters of the Church had been established .
1 Verily , thus saith the Lord unto you , my servant Joseph Smith , I am well pleased with your a offering and acknowledgments , which you have made ; for unto this end have I raised you up , that I might show forth my b wisdom through the c weak things of the earth .
2 Your prayers are acceptable before me ; and in answer to them I say unto you , that you are now called immediately to make a solemn a proclamation of my gospel , and of this b stake which I have planted to be a c cornerstone of Zion , which shall be polished with the refinement which is after the similitude of a palace .
3 This proclamation shall be made to all the a kings of the world , to the four corners thereof , to the honorable president ##AT##-##AT## elect , and the high ##AT##-##AT## minded governors of the nation in which you live , and to all the nations of the earth scattered abroad .
5 For it shall be a given you by the Holy Ghost to know my b will concerning those c kings and authorities , even what shall befall them in a time to come .
6 For , behold , I am about to call upon them to give heed to the light and glory of Zion , for the set time has come to favor her .
8 And that I may a visit them in the day of visitation , when I shall b unveil the face of my covering , to appoint the portion of the c oppressor among hypocrites , where there is d gnashing of teeth , if they reject my servants and my testimony which I have revealed unto them .
9 And again , I will visit and soften their hearts , many of them for your good , that ye may find grace in their eyes , that they may come to the a light of truth , and the Gentiles to the exaltation or lifting up of Zion .
10 For the day of my visitation cometh speedily , in an a hour when ye think not of ; and where shall be the safety of my people , and refuge for those who shall be left of them ?
11 Awake , O kings of the earth !
Come ye , O , come ye , with your a gold and your silver , to the help of my people , to the house of the daughters of Zion .
14 But let him remember that his a stewardship will I require at his hands .
15 And again , verily I say unto you , blessed is my servant Hyrum Smith ; for I , the Lord , love him because of the a integrity of his heart , and because he loveth that which is right before me , saith the Lord .
16 Again , let my servant John C. Bennett help you in your labor in sending my word to the kings and people of the earth , and stand by you , even you my servant Joseph Smith , in the hour of affliction ; and his reward shall not fail if he receive a counsel .
17 And for his love he shall be great , for he shall be mine if he do this , saith the Lord .
I have seen the work which he hath done , which I accept if he continue , and will crown him with blessings and great glory .
18 And again , I say unto you that it is my will that my servant Lyman Wight should continue in preaching for Zion , in the spirit of meekness , confessing me before the world ; and I will bear him up as on a eagles ’ wings ; and he shall beget glory and honor to himself and unto my name .
19 That when he shall finish his work I may a receive him unto myself , even as I did my servant David Patten , who is with me at this time , and also my servant b Edward Partridge , and also my aged servant Joseph Smith , Sen. , who sitteth c with Abraham at his right hand , and blessed and holy is he , for he is mine .
20 And again , verily I say unto you , my servant George Miller is without a guile ; he may be trusted because of the b integrity of his heart ; and for the love which he has to my testimony I , the Lord , love him .
21 I therefore say unto you , I seal upon his head the office of a bishopric , like unto my a servant Edward Partridge , that he may receive the consecrations of mine house , that he may administer blessings upon the heads of the poor of my people , saith the Lord .
Let no man despise my servant George , for he shall honor me .
22 Let my servant George , and my servant Lyman , and my servant John Snider , and others , build a a house unto my name , such a one as my servant Joseph shall show unto them , upon the place which he shall show unto them also .
23 And it shall be for a house for boarding , a house that strangers may come from afar to lodge therein ; therefore let it be a good house , worthy of all acceptation , that the weary a traveler may find health and safety while he shall contemplate the word of the Lord ; and the b corner ##AT##-##AT## stone I have appointed for Zion .
24 This house shall be a healthful habitation if it be built unto my name , and if the governor which shall be appointed unto it shall not suffer any pollution to come upon it .
It shall be holy , or the Lord your God will not a dwell therein .
25 And again , verily I say unto you , let all my saints a come from afar .
27 And with iron , with copper , and with brass , and with zinc , and with all your precious things of the earth ; and build a a house to my name , for the Most High to b dwell therein .
28 For there is not a place found on earth that he may come to and a restore again that which was lost unto you , or which he hath taken away , even the fulness of the priesthood .
30 For this ordinance belongeth to my house , and cannot be acceptable to me , only in the days of your poverty , wherein ye are not able to build a house unto me .
31 But I command you , all ye my saints , to a build a house unto me ; and I grant unto you a sufficient time to build a house unto me ; and during this time your baptisms shall be acceptable unto me .
32 But behold , at the end of this appointment your baptisms for your dead shall not be acceptable unto me ; and if you do not these things at the end of the appointment ye shall be rejected as a church , with your dead , saith the Lord your God .
34 For therein are the a keys of the holy priesthood ordained , that you may receive honor and glory .
35 And after this time , your baptisms for the dead , by those who are scattered abroad , are not acceptable unto me , saith the Lord .
36 For it is ordained that in Zion , and in her stakes , and in Jerusalem , those places which I have appointed for a refuge , shall be the places for your baptisms for your dead .
37 And again , verily I say unto you , how shall your a washings be acceptable unto me , except ye perform them in a house which you have built to my name ?
38 For , for this cause I commanded Moses that he should build a a tabernacle , that they should bear it with them in the wilderness , and to build a house in the land of promise , that those ordinances might be revealed which had been hid from before the world was .
41 For I deign to a reveal unto my church things which have been kept b hid from before the foundation of the world , things that pertain to the dispensation of the c fulness of times .
42 And a I will show unto my servant Joseph all things pertaining to this house , and the priesthood thereof , and the place whereon it shall be built .
43 And ye shall build it on the place where you have contemplated building it , for that is the spot which I have chosen for you to build it .
44 If ye labor with all your might , I will consecrate that spot that it shall be made a holy .
45 And if my people will hearken unto my voice , and unto the voice of my a servants whom I have appointed to lead my people , behold , verily I say unto you , they shall not be moved out of their place .
46 But if they will not a hearken to my voice , nor unto the voice of these men whom I have appointed , they shall not be blest , because they b pollute mine holy grounds , and mine holy ordinances , and charters , and my holy words which I give unto them .
47 And it shall come to pass that if you build a house unto my name , and do not do the things that I say , I will not perform the a oath which I make unto you , neither fulfil the promises which ye expect at my hands , saith the Lord .
48 For a instead of blessings , ye , by your own works , bring cursings , wrath , indignation , and judgments upon your own heads , by your follies , and by all your abominations , which you practise before me , saith the Lord .
50 And the iniquity and transgression of my holy laws and commandments I will a visit upon the heads of those who hindered my work , unto the third and fourth b generation , so long as they repent not , and hate me , saith the Lord God .
51 Therefore , for this cause have I accepted the offerings of those whom I commanded to build up a city and a a house unto my name , in Jackson county , Missouri , and were hindered by their enemies , saith the Lord your God .
52 And I will answer a judgment , wrath , and indignation , wailing , and anguish , and gnashing of teeth upon their heads , unto the third and fourth generation , so long as they repent not , and hate me , saith the Lord your God .
53 And this I make an a example unto you , for your consolation concerning all those who have been commanded to do a work and have been hindered by the hands of their enemies , and by b oppression , saith the Lord your God .
54 For I am the Lord your God , and will save all those of your brethren who have been a pure in heart , and have been b slain in the land of Missouri , saith the Lord .
55 And again , verily I say unto you , I command you again to build a a house to my name , even in this place , that you may b prove yourselves unto me that ye are c faithful in all things whatsoever I command you , that I may bless you , and crown you with honor , immortality , and eternal life .
56 And now I say unto you , as pertaining to my boarding a house which I have commanded you to build for the boarding of strangers , let it be built unto my name , and let my name be named upon it , and let my servant Joseph and his house have place therein , from generation to generation .
57 For this a anointing have I put upon his head , that his blessing shall also be put upon the head of his posterity after him .
58 And as I said unto a Abraham concerning the kindreds of the earth , even so I say unto my servant Joseph : In thee and in thy b seed shall the kindred of the earth be blessed .
59 Therefore , let my servant Joseph and his seed after him have place in that house , from generation to generation , forever and ever , saith the Lord .
61 That he may receive also the counsel from those whom I have set to be as a plants of renown , and as b watchmen upon her walls .
62 Behold , verily I say unto you , let my servant George Miller , and my servant Lyman Wight , and my servant John Snider , and my servant Peter Haws , organize themselves , and appoint one of them to be a president over their quorum for the purpose of building that house .
63 And they shall form a constitution , whereby they may receive stock for the building of that house .
64 And they shall not receive less than fifty dollars for a share of stock in that house , and they shall be permitted to receive fifteen thousand dollars from any one man for stock in that house .
65 But they shall not be permitted to receive over fifteen thousand dollars stock from any one man .
66 And they shall not be permitted to receive under fifty dollars for a share of stock from any one man in that house .
68 And in proportion to the amount of stock he pays into their hands he shall receive stock in that house ; but if he pays nothing into their hands he shall not receive any stock in that house .
69 And if any pay stock into their hands it shall be for stock in that house , for himself , and for his generation after him , from generation to generation , so long as he and his heirs shall hold that stock , and do not sell or convey the stock away out of their hands by their own free will and act , if you will do my will , saith the Lord your God .
70 And again , verily I say unto you , if my servant George Miller , and my servant Lyman Wight , and my servant John Snider , and my servant Peter Haws , receive any stock into their hands , in moneys , or in properties wherein they receive the real value of moneys , they shall not appropriate any portion of that stock to any other purpose , only in that house .
71 And if they do appropriate any portion of that stock anywhere else , only in that house , without the consent of the stockholder , and do not repay fourfold for the stock which they appropriate anywhere else , only in that house , they shall be accursed , and shall be moved out of their place , saith the Lord God ; for I , the Lord , am God , and cannot be a mocked in any of these things .
72 Verily I say unto you , let my servant Joseph pay stock into their hands for the building of that house , as seemeth him good ; but my servant Joseph cannot pay over fifteen thousand dollars stock in that house , nor under fifty dollars ; neither can any other man , saith the Lord .
73 And there are others also who wish to know my will concerning them , for they have asked it at my hands .
74 Therefore , I say unto you concerning my servant Vinson Knight , if he will do my will let him put stock into that house for himself , and for his generation after him , from generation to generation .
75 And let him lift up his voice long and loud , in the midst of the people , to a plead the cause of the poor and the needy ; and let him not fail , neither let his heart faint ; and I will b accept of his offerings , for they shall not be unto me as the offerings of Cain , for he shall be mine , saith the Lord .
76 Let his family rejoice and turn away their hearts from affliction ; for I have chosen him and anointed him , and he shall be honored in the midst of his house , for I will forgive all his sins , saith the Lord .
77 Verily I say unto you , let my servant Hyrum put stock into that house as seemeth him good , for himself and his generation after him , from generation to generation .
78 Let my servant Isaac Galland put stock into that house ; for I , the Lord , love him for the work he hath done , and will forgive all his sins ; therefore , let him be remembered for an interest in that house from generation to generation .
79 Let my servant Isaac Galland be appointed among you , and be ordained by my servant William Marks , and be blessed of him , to go with my servant Hyrum to accomplish the work that my servant Joseph shall point out to them , and they shall be greatly blessed .
80 Let my servant William Marks pay stock into that house , as seemeth him good , for himself and his generation , from generation to generation .
81 Let my servant Henry G. Sherwood pay stock into that house , as seemeth him good , for himself and his seed after him , from generation to generation .
82 Let my servant William Law pay stock into that house , for himself and his seed after him , from generation to generation .
83 If he will do my will let him not take his family unto the eastern lands , even unto Kirtland ; nevertheless , I , the Lord , will build up a Kirtland , but I , the Lord , have a scourge prepared for the inhabitants thereof .
84 And with my servant Almon Babbitt , there are many things with which I am not pleased ; behold , he aspireth to establish his counsel instead of the counsel which I have ordained , even that of the Presidency of my Church ; and he setteth up a a golden calf for the worship of my people .
85 Let no man a go from this place who has come here essaying to keep my commandments .
86 If they live here let them live unto me ; and if they die let them die unto me ; for they shall a rest from all their labors here , and shall continue their works .
87 Therefore , let my servant William put his trust in me , and cease to fear concerning his family , because of the sickness of the land .
If ye a love me , keep my commandments ; and the sickness of the land shall b redound to your glory .
88 Let my servant William go and proclaim my everlasting gospel with a loud voice , and with great joy , as he shall be moved upon by my a Spirit , unto the inhabitants of Warsaw , and also unto the inhabitants of Carthage , and also unto the inhabitants of Burlington , and also unto the inhabitants of Madison , and await patiently and diligently for further instructions at my general conference , saith the Lord .
89 If he will do my a will let him from henceforth hearken to the counsel of my servant Joseph , and with his interest support the b cause of the poor , and publish c the new translation of my holy word unto the inhabitants of the earth .
90 And if he will do this I will a bless him with a multiplicity of blessings , that he shall not be forsaken , nor his seed be found b begging bread .
93 That whoever he blesses shall be blessed , and whoever he a curses shall be cursed ; that whatsoever he shall b bind on earth shall be bound in heaven ; and whatsoever he shall loose on earth shall be loosed in heaven .
96 That my servant Hyrum may bear record of the things which I shall show unto him , that his name may be had in honorable remembrance from generation to generation , forever and ever .
97 Let my servant William Law also receive the keys by which he may ask and receive blessings ; let him be a humble before me , and be without b guile , and he shall receive of my Spirit , even the c Comforter , which shall manifest unto him the truth of all things , and shall give him , in the very hour , what he shall say .
99 And he shall be led in paths where the poisonous serpent a cannot lay hold upon his heel , and he shall mount up in the b imagination of his thoughts as upon eagles ’ wings .
100 And what if I will that he should a raise the dead , let him not withhold his voice .
101 Therefore , let my servant William cry aloud and spare not , with joy and rejoicing , and with hosannas to him that sitteth upon the throne forever and ever , saith the Lord your God .
102 Behold , I say unto you , I have a mission in store for my servant William , and my servant Hyrum , and for them alone ; and let my servant Joseph tarry at home , for he is needed .
The remainder I will show unto you hereafter .
103 And again , verily I say unto you , if my servant Sidney will serve me and be a counselor unto my servant Joseph , let him arise and come up and stand in the office of his calling , and humble himself before me .
104 And if he will offer unto me an acceptable offering , and acknowledgments , and remain with my people , behold , I , the Lord your God , will heal him that he shall be healed ; and he shall lift up his voice again on the mountains , and be a a spokesman before my face .
105 Let him come and locate his family in the neighborhood in which my servant Joseph resides .
106 And in all his journeyings let him lift up his voice as with the sound of a trump , and warn the inhabitants of the earth to flee the wrath to come .
107 Let him assist my servant Joseph , and also let my servant William Law assist my servant Joseph , in making a solemn a proclamation unto the kings of the earth , even as I have before said unto you .
108 If my servant Sidney will do my will , let him not remove his family unto the a eastern lands , but let him change their habitation , even as I have said .
109 Behold , it is not my will that he shall seek to find safety and refuge out of the city which I have appointed unto you , even the city of Nauvoo .
110 Verily I say unto you , even now , if he will hearken unto my voice , it shall be well with him .
111 And again , verily I say unto you , let my servant Amos Davies pay stock into the hands of those whom I have appointed to build a house for boarding , even the Nauvoo House .
112 This let him do if he will have an interest ; and let him hearken unto the counsel of my servant Joseph , and labor with his own hands that he may obtain the confidence of men .
114 Let him therefore a abase himself that he may be exalted .
115 And again , verily I say unto you , if my servant Robert D. Foster will obey my voice , let him build a house for my servant Joseph , according to the contract which he has made with him , as the door shall be open to him from time to time .
118 And hearken unto the counsel of my servants Joseph , and Hyrum , and William Law , and unto the authorities which I have called to lay the foundation of Zion ; and it shall be well with him forever and ever .
120 For that which is a more or less than this cometh of evil , and shall be attended with cursings and not blessings , saith the Lord your God .
121 And again , verily I say unto you , let the quorum of the Nauvoo House have a just recompense of wages for all their labors which they do in building the Nauvoo House ; and let their wages be as shall be agreed among themselves , as pertaining to the price thereof .
122 And let every man who pays stock bear his proportion of their wages , if it must needs be , for their support , saith the Lord ; otherwise , their labors shall be accounted unto them for stock in that house .
123 Verily I say unto you , I now give unto you the a officers belonging to my Priesthood , that ye may hold the b keys thereof , even the Priesthood which is after the order of Melchizedek , which is after the order of mine c Only Begotten Son .
124 First , I give unto you Hyrum Smith to be a a patriarch unto you , to hold the b sealing blessings of my church , even the Holy Spirit of c promise , whereby ye are d sealed up unto the day of redemption , that ye may not fall notwithstanding the e hour of temptation that may come upon you .
125 I give unto you my servant Joseph to be a presiding elder over all my church , to be a translator , a revelator , a a seer , and prophet .
126 I give unto him for a counselors my servant Sidney Rigdon and my servant William Law , that these may constitute a quorum and First Presidency , to receive the b oracles for the whole church .
128 Which a Twelve hold the keys to open up the authority of my kingdom upon the four corners of the earth , and after that to send my word to every b creature .
130 David Patten I have a taken unto myself ; behold , his b priesthood no man c taketh from him ; but , verily I say unto you , another may be appointed unto the same calling .
132 Namely , Samuel Bent , Henry G. Sherwood , George W. Harris , Charles C. Rich , Thomas Grover , Newel Knight , David Dort , Dunbar Wilson — Seymour Brunson I have taken unto myself ; no man taketh his priesthood , but another may be appointed unto the same priesthood in his stead ; and verily I say unto you , let my servant Aaron Johnson be ordained unto this calling in his stead — David Fullmer , Alpheus Cutler , William Huntington .
135 And they may travel also if they choose , but rather be ordained for standing presidents ; this is the office of their calling , saith the Lord your God .
136 I give unto him Amasa Lyman and Noah Packard for counselors , that they may preside over the quorum of high priests of my church , saith the Lord .
137 And again , I say unto you , I give unto you John A. Hicks , Samuel Williams , and Jesse Baker , which priesthood is to preside over the quorum of a elders , which quorum is instituted for standing ministers ; nevertheless they may travel , yet they are ordained to be standing ministers to my church , saith the Lord .
139 Which quorum is instituted for a traveling elders to bear record of my name in all the world , wherever the traveling high council , mine apostles , shall send them to prepare a way before my face .
140 The difference between this quorum and the quorum of elders is that one is to travel continually , and the other is to preside over the churches from time to time ; the one has the responsibility of presiding from time to time , and the other has no responsibility of presiding , saith the Lord your God .
141 And again , I say unto you , I give unto you Vinson Knight , Samuel H. Smith , and Shadrach Roundy , if he will receive it , to preside over the a bishopric ; a knowledge of said bishopric is given unto you in the book of Doctrine and Covenants .
142 And again , I say unto you , Samuel Rolfe and his counselors for a priests , and the president of the teachers and his counselors , and also the president of the deacons and his counselors , and also the president of the stake and his counselors .
143 The above a offices I have given unto you , and the keys thereof , for helps and for governments , for the work of the ministry and the b perfecting of my saints .
145 And that ye should prepare rooms for all these offices in my a house when you build it unto my name , saith the Lord your God .
Instructions by Joseph Smith the Prophet , given at Ramus , Illinois , May 16 and 17 , 1843 . HC 5 : 392 – 393 .
1 – 4 , Celestial marriage is essential to exaltation in the highest heaven ; 5 – 6 , How men are sealed up unto eternal life ; 7 – 8 , All spirit is matter .
3 And if he does not , he cannot obtain it .
4 He may enter into the other , but that is the end of his kingdom ; he cannot have an a increase .
5 ( May 17th , 1843 . ) The more sure word of a prophecy means a man ’ s knowing that he is b sealed up unto c eternal life , by revelation and the spirit of prophecy , through the power of the Holy Priesthood .
6 It is impossible for a man to be a saved in b ignorance .
7 There is no such thing as immaterial matter .
8 We cannot a see it ; but when our bodies are purified we shall see that it is all b matter .
Revelation given through Joseph Smith the Prophet , in the presence of six elders , at Fayette , New York , September 1830 . HC 1 : 111 – 115 .
This revelation was given some days prior to the conference beginning September 26 , 1830 .
2 Who will a gather his people even as a hen gathereth her chickens under her wings , even as many as will hearken to my voice and b humble themselves before me , and call upon me in mighty prayer .
3 Behold , verily , verily , I say unto you , that at this time your a sins are b forgiven you , therefore ye receive these things ; but remember to sin no more , lest perils shall come upon you .
4 Verily , I say unto you that ye are chosen out of the world to declare my gospel with the sound of rejoicing , as with the a voice of a trump .
5 Lift up your hearts and be a glad , for I am in your b midst , and am your c advocate with the Father ; and it is his good will to give you the d kingdom .
6 And , as it is written — Whatsoever ye shall a ask in b faith , being c united in prayer according to my command , ye shall receive .
8 Wherefore the decree hath gone forth from the Father that they shall be a gathered in unto one place upon the face of this land , to b prepare their hearts and be prepared in all things against the day when c tribulation and desolation are sent forth upon the wicked .
11 For I will reveal a myself from heaven with power and great glory , with all the b hosts thereof , and c dwell in d righteousness with men on earth a e thousand years , and the wicked shall not stand .
13 For a a trump shall sound both long and loud , even as upon Mount Sinai , and all the b earth shall quake , and they shall c come forth — yea , even the d dead which died in me , to receive a e crown of righteousness , and to be clothed upon , f even as I am , to be with me , that we may be one .
16 And there shall be a great a hailstorm sent forth to destroy the b crops of the earth .
17 And it shall come to pass , because of the wickedness of the world , that I will take a vengeance upon the b wicked , for they will not repent ; for the c cup of mine d indignation is full ; for behold , my e blood shall not f cleanse them if they hear me not .
20 And it shall come to pass that the a beasts of the forest and the fowls of the air shall devour them up .
21 And the great and a abominable church , which is the b whore of all the earth , shall be cast down by c devouring fire , according as it is spoken by the mouth of Ezekiel the prophet , who spoke of these things , which have not come to pass but surely d must , as I live , for e abominations shall not reign .
23 And the a end shall come , and the heaven and the earth shall be consumed and b pass away , and there shall be a new heaven and a c new earth .
25 And not one a hair , neither mote , shall be lost , for it is the b workmanship of mine hand .
26 But , behold , verily I say unto you , before the earth shall pass away , a Michael , mine archangel , shall sound his b trump , and then shall all the dead c awake , for their graves shall be opened , and they shall d come forth — yea , even all .
28 Wherefore I will say unto them — a Depart from me , ye cursed , into everlasting b fire , prepared for the c devil and his angels .
29 And now , behold , I say unto you , never at any time have I declared from mine own mouth that they should return , for a where I am they cannot come , for they have no power .
30 But remember that all my judgments are not given unto men ; and as the words have gone forth out of my mouth even so shall they be fulfilled , that the a first shall be last , and that the last shall be first in all things whatsoever I have created by the word of my power , which is the power of my b Spirit .
33 a Speaking unto you that you may naturally understand ; but unto myself my works have no b end , neither beginning ; but it is given unto you that ye may understand , because ye have asked it of me and are agreed .
34 Wherefore , verily I say unto you that all things unto me are spiritual , and not at any time have I given unto you a a law which was b temporal ; neither any man , nor the children of men ; neither Adam , your father , whom I created .
35 Behold , I gave unto him that he should be an a agent unto himself ; and I gave unto him commandment , but no temporal commandment gave I unto him , for my b commandments are c spiritual ; they are not natural nor temporal , neither carnal nor sensual .
38 And , behold , there is a place a prepared for them from the beginning , which place is b hell .
40 Wherefore , it came to pass that the devil tempted Adam , and he partook of the forbidden a fruit and b transgressed the commandment , wherein he became c subject to the will of the devil , because he yielded unto temptation .
41 Wherefore , I , the Lord God , caused that he should be a cast out from the Garden of b Eden , from my presence , because of his transgression , wherein he became c spiritually d dead , which is the first death , even that same death which is the last e death , which is spiritual , which shall be pronounced upon the wicked when I shall say : Depart , ye f cursed .
42 But , behold , I say unto you that I , the Lord God , gave unto Adam and unto his seed , that they should not a die as to the temporal death , until I , the Lord God , should send forth b angels to declare unto them c repentance and d redemption , through faith on the name of mine e Only Begotten Son .
45 For they love darkness rather than light , and their a deeds are evil , and they receive their b wages of c whom they list to obey .
48 For it is given unto them even as I will , according to mine own a pleasure , that great things may be required at the hand of their b fathers .
49 And , again , I say unto you , that whoso having knowledge , have I not commanded to a repent ?
50 And he that hath no a understanding , it remaineth in me to do according as it is written .
And now I declare no more unto you at this time .
Revelation given through Joseph Smith the Prophet , in Zion , Jackson County , Missouri , August 7 , 1831 . HC 1 : 196 – 201 .
Preceding his record of this revelation , the Prophet writes descriptively of the land of Zion wherein the people were then assembled .
The land was consecrated , as the Lord had directed , and the site for the future temple was dedicated .
The Lord makes these commandments especially applicable to the saints in Zion .
1 – 4 , The faithful saints in Zion shall be blessed ; 5 – 8 , They are to love and serve the Lord and keep his commandments ; 9 – 19 , By keeping the Lord ’ s day holy , the saints are blessed temporally and spiritually ; 20 – 24 , The righteous are promised peace in this world and eternal life in the world to come .
1 Behold , blessed , saith the Lord , are they who have come up unto this land with an a eye single to my glory , according to my commandments .
2 For those that live shall a inherit the earth , and those that b die shall rest from all their labors , and their works shall follow them ; and they shall receive a c crown in the d mansions of my Father , which I have prepared for them .
3 Yea , blessed are they whose feet stand upon the land of Zion , who have obeyed my gospel ; for they shall receive for their reward the good things of the earth , and it shall bring forth in its a strength .
4 And they shall also be crowned with blessings from above , yea , and with a commandments not a few , and with b revelations in their time — they that are c faithful and d diligent before me .
5 Wherefore , I give unto them a commandment , saying thus : Thou shalt a love the Lord thy God with all thy b heart , with all thy might , mind , and strength ; and in the name of Jesus Christ thou shalt c serve him .
6 Thou shalt a love thy b neighbor as thyself .
Thou shalt not c steal ; neither commit d adultery , nor e kill , nor do anything f like unto it .
7 Thou shalt a thank the Lord thy God in all things .
8 Thou shalt offer a a sacrifice unto the Lord thy God in b righteousness , even that of a broken heart and a c contrite spirit .
12 But remember that on this , the a Lord ’ s day , thou shalt offer thine b oblations and thy sacraments unto the Most High , c confessing thy sins unto thy brethren , and before the Lord .
13 And on this day thou shalt do none other thing , only let thy food be prepared with singleness of heart that thy a fasting may be perfect , or , in other words , that thy b joy may be full .
14 Verily , this is fasting and prayer , or in other words , rejoicing and prayer .
19 Yea , for a food and for raiment , for taste and for smell , to b strengthen the body and to enliven the soul .
20 And it pleaseth God that he hath given all these things unto man ; for unto this end were they made to be used , with judgment , not to a excess , neither by extortion .
21 And in nothing doth man a offend God , or against none is his b wrath c kindled , save those who d confess not his hand in all things , and e obey not his commandments .
22 Behold , this is according to the law and the prophets ; wherefore , trouble me no more concerning this matter .
23 But learn that he who doeth the works of a righteousness shall receive his b reward , even c peace in this world , and d eternal life in the world to come .
24 I , the Lord , have spoken it , and the Spirit beareth record .
Revelation given through Joseph Smith the Prophet , at Kirtland , Ohio , September 22 and 23 , 1832 . HC 1 : 286 – 295 .
During the month of September , elders had begun to return from their missions in the eastern states and to make reports of their labors .
It was while they were together in this season of joy that the following communication was received .
The Prophet designates it a revelation on priesthood .
1 A a revelation of Jesus Christ unto his servant Joseph Smith , Jun . , and six elders , as they b united their hearts and c lifted their voices on high .
2 Yea , the word of the Lord concerning his church , established in the last days for the a restoration of his people , as he has spoken by the mouth of his b prophets , and for the c gathering of his d saints to stand upon e Mount Zion , which shall be the city of f New Jerusalem .
3 Which city shall be a built , beginning at the b temple lot , which is appointed by the finger of the Lord , in the western boundaries of the State of Missouri , and c dedicated by the hand of Joseph Smith , Jun . , and others with whom the Lord was well pleased .
4 Verily this is the word of the Lord , that the city a New Jerusalem shall be built by the gathering of the saints , beginning at this place , even the place of the temple , which b temple shall be c reared in this d generation .
5 For verily this generation shall not all a pass away until an b house shall be built unto the Lord , and a c cloud shall rest upon it , which cloud shall be even the d glory of the Lord , which shall fill the house .
12 And Esaias received it under the hand of God .
17 Which a priesthood b continueth in the church of God in all generations , and is without c beginning of days or end of years .
18 And the Lord confirmed a a priesthood also upon b Aaron and his c seed , throughout all their generations , which priesthood also continueth and d abideth forever with the priesthood which is after the holiest order of God .
19 And this greater a priesthood administereth the gospel and holdeth the b key of the c mysteries of the kingdom , even the key of the d knowledge of God .
20 Therefore , in the a ordinances thereof , the power of b godliness is manifest .
22 For without this no a man can see the face of God , even the Father , and live .
24 But they a hardened their hearts and could not endure his b presence ; therefore , the Lord in his c wrath , for his d anger was kindled against them , swore that they should not e enter into his rest while in the wilderness , which rest is the fulness of his glory .
27 Which a gospel is the gospel of b repentance and of c baptism , and the d remission of sins , and the e law of f carnal commandments , which the Lord in his wrath caused to continue with the house of Aaron among the children of Israel until g John , whom God raised up , being h filled with the Holy Ghost from his mother ’ s womb .
28 For he was baptized while he was yet in his childhood , and was a ordained by the angel of God at the time he was b eight days old unto this power , to overthrow the kingdom of the Jews , and to c make straight the way of the Lord before the face of his people , to prepare them for the d coming of the Lord , in whose hand is given e all power .
29 And again , the a offices of elder and bishop are necessary b appendages belonging unto the high priesthood .
30 And again , the offices of a teacher and deacon are necessary appendages belonging to the lesser priesthood , which priesthood was confirmed upon b Aaron and his sons .
32 And the sons of Moses and of Aaron shall be filled with the a glory of the Lord , upon b Mount Zion in the Lord ’ s house , whose sons are ye ; and also many whom I have called and sent forth to build up my c church .
33 For whoso is a faithful unto the obtaining these two b priesthoods of which I have spoken , and the c magnifying their calling , are d sanctified by the Spirit unto the e renewing of their bodies .
34 They become the a sons of Moses and of Aaron and the b seed of c Abraham , and the church and kingdom , and the d elect of God .
38 And he that receiveth my Father receiveth my Father ’ s a kingdom ; therefore b all that my Father hath shall be given unto him .
39 And this is according to the a oath and covenant which belongeth to the priesthood .
40 Therefore , all those who receive the a priesthood , receive this b oath and covenant of my Father , which he cannot break , neither can it be moved .
41 But whoso breaketh this a covenant after he hath received it , and altogether turneth therefrom , shall b not have forgiveness of sins in this world nor in the world to come .
42 And wo unto all those who come not unto this priesthood which ye have received , which I now confirm upon you who are present this day , by mine own voice out of the heavens ; and even I have given the heavenly hosts and mine angels a charge concerning you .
43 And I now give unto you a commandment to beware concerning yourselves , to give a diligent b heed to the words of eternal life .
44 For you shall a live by every word that proceedeth forth from the mouth of God .
45 For the a word of the Lord is truth , and whatsoever is truth is b light , and whatsoever is light is c Spirit , even the Spirit of Jesus Christ .
46 And the a Spirit giveth b light to c every man that cometh into the world ; and the Spirit enlighteneth every man through the world , that hearkeneth to the voice of the Spirit .
47 And every one that hearkeneth to the voice of the Spirit a cometh unto God , even the Father .
48 And the Father a teacheth him of the covenant which he has b renewed and confirmed upon you , which is confirmed upon you for your sakes , and not for your sakes only , but for the sake of the c whole world .
49 And the whole a world lieth in sin , and groaneth under b darkness and under the c bondage of sin .
50 And by this you may know they are under the a bondage of sin , because they come not unto me .
51 For whoso cometh not unto me is under the a bondage of sin .
52 And whoso receiveth not my voice is not acquainted with a my voice , and is not of me .
53 And by this you may know the righteous from the wicked , and that the whole a world b groaneth under sin and darkness even now .
55 Which a vanity and unbelief have brought the whole church under condemnation .
56 And this condemnation resteth upon the children of a Zion , even all .
58 That they may bring forth a fruit meet for their Father ’ s kingdom ; otherwise there remaineth a b scourge and judgment to be poured out upon the children of Zion .
59 For shall the children of the kingdom a pollute my holy land ?
61 For I will a forgive you of your sins with this commandment — that you remain b steadfast in your minds in c solemnity and the spirit of prayer , in bearing d testimony to all the world of those things which are communicated unto you .
62 Therefore , a go ye into all the world ; and unto whatsoever place ye cannot go ye shall send , that the testimony may go from you into all the world unto every creature .
64 Therefore , as I said unto mine apostles I say unto you again , that every a soul who b believeth on your words , and is baptized by water for the c remission of sins , shall d receive the Holy Ghost .
72 And the a poison of a serpent shall not have power to harm them .
73 But a commandment I give unto them , that they shall not a boast themselves of these things , neither speak them before the world ; for these things are given unto you for your profit and for salvation .
74 Verily , verily , I say unto you , they who believe not on your words , and are not a baptized in water in my name , for the b remission of their sins , that they may receive the Holy Ghost , shall be c damned , and shall not come into my Father ’ s kingdom where my Father and I am .
75 And this revelation unto you , and commandment , is in force from this very hour upon all the a world , and the gospel is unto all who have not received it .
76 But , verily I say unto all those to whom the kingdom has been given — from you it a must be b preached unto them , that they shall repent of their former evil works ; for they are to be upbraided for their evil c hearts of unbelief , and your brethren in Zion for their d rebellion against you at the time I sent you .
78 For I suffered them not to have a purse or scrip , neither two coats .
79 Behold , I a send you out to b prove the world , and the laborer is worthy of his c hire .
80 And any man that shall go and preach this a gospel of the kingdom , and fail not to continue b faithful in all things , shall not be weary in mind , neither darkened , neither in body , limb , nor joint ; and a c hair of his head shall not fall to the ground unnoticed .
And they shall not go hungry , neither athirst .
81 Therefore , take ye no a thought for the morrow , for what ye shall eat , or what ye shall drink , or wherewithal ye shall be clothed .
82 For , a consider the b lilies of the field , how they grow , they toil not , neither do they spin ; and the kingdoms of the world , in all their glory , are not arrayed like one of these .
83 For your a Father , who is in heaven , b knoweth that you have need of all these things .
84 Therefore , let the morrow take a thought for the things of itself .
85 Neither take ye thought beforehand a what ye shall say ; but b treasure up in your minds continually the words of life , and it shall be c given you in the very hour that portion that shall be meted unto every man .
86 Therefore , let no man among you , for this commandment is unto all the a faithful who are called of God in the church unto the ministry , from this hour take purse or scrip , that goeth forth to proclaim this gospel of the kingdom .
87 Behold , I send you out to a reprove the world of all their unrighteous deeds , and to teach them of a judgment which is to come .
88 And whoso a receiveth you , there I will be also , for I will go b before your face .
I will be on your right hand and on your left , and my c Spirit shall be in your hearts , and mine d angels round about you , to bear you up .
89 Whoso receiveth you receiveth me ; and the same will feed you , and clothe you , and give you money .
90 And he who feeds you , or clothes you , or gives you money , shall in nowise a lose his reward .
91 And he that doeth not these things is not my disciple ; by this you may know a my disciples .
92 He that receiveth you not , go away from him alone by yourselves , and a cleanse your feet even with water , pure water , whether in heat or in cold , and bear testimony of it unto your Father which is in heaven , and return not again unto that man .
93 And in whatsoever village or city ye enter , do likewise .
94 Nevertheless , search diligently and spare not ; and wo unto that house , or that village or city that rejecteth you , or your words , or your testimony concerning me .
96 For I , the a Almighty , have laid my hands upon the nations , to b scourge them for their c wickedness .
103 And again , verily , verily , I say unto you , it is expedient that every man who goes forth to proclaim mine everlasting gospel , that inasmuch as they have a families , and receive b money by gift , that they should send it unto them or make use of it for their benefit , as the Lord shall direct them , for thus it seemeth me good .
104 And let all those who have not families , who receive a money , send it up unto the bishop in Zion , or unto the bishop in Ohio , that it may be consecrated for the bringing forth of the revelations and the printing thereof , and for establishing Zion .
105 And if any man shall give unto any of you a coat , or a suit , take the old and cast it unto the a poor , and go on your way rejoicing .
106 And if any man among you be a strong in the Spirit , let him take with him him that is b weak , that he may be c edified in all d meekness , that he may become strong also .
107 Therefore , take with you those who are ordained unto the a lesser priesthood , and send them b before you to make appointments , and to prepare the way , and to fill appointments that you yourselves are not able to fill .
108 Behold , this is the way that mine apostles , in ancient days , built up my church unto me .
109 Therefore , let every man stand in his own a office , and b labor in his own calling ; and let not the c head say unto the feet it hath no need of the feet ; for without the feet how shall the body be able to stand ?
110 Also the body hath need of every a member , that all may be b edified together , that the system may be kept perfect .
111 And behold , the a high priests should travel , and also the elders , and also the lesser b priests ; but the c deacons and d teachers should be appointed to e watch over the church , to be standing ministers unto the church .
112 And the bishop , Newel K. Whitney , also should travel round about and among all the churches , searching after the poor to a administer to their wants by b humbling the rich and the proud .
113 He should also employ an a agent to take charge and to do his secular business as he shall direct .
114 Nevertheless , let the bishop go unto the city of New York , also to the city of Albany , and also to the city of Boston , and warn the people of those a cities with the sound of the gospel , with a loud voice , of the b desolation and utter abolishment which await them if they do reject these things .
115 For if they do reject these things the hour of their judgment is nigh , and their house shall be left unto them a desolate .
116 Let him a trust in me and he shall not be b confounded ; and a c hair of his head shall not fall to the ground unnoticed .
117 And verily I say unto you , the rest of my servants , go ye forth as your circumstances shall permit , in your several callings , unto the great and notable cities and villages , a reproving the world in righteousness of all their unrighteous and ungodly deeds , setting forth clearly and understandingly the desolation of b abomination in the last days .
118 For , with you saith the Lord a Almighty , I will b rend their c kingdoms ; I will not only d shake the earth , but the e starry heavens shall tremble .
119 For I , the Lord , have put forth my hand to exert the a powers of heaven ; ye cannot see it now , yet a b little while and ye shall see it , and know that I am , and that c I will d come and reign with my people .
120 I am a Alpha and Omega , the beginning and the end .
Joseph Smith tells of his ancestry , family members , and their early abodes — An unusual excitement about religion prevails in western New York — He determines to seek wisdom as directed by James — The Father and the Son appear and Joseph is called to his prophetic ministry .
2 In this history I shall present the various events in relation to this Church , in truth and righteousness , as they have transpired , or as they at present exist , being now &#91; 1838 &#93; the a eighth b year since the organization of the said Church .
3 a I was born in the year of our Lord one thousand eight hundred and five , on the twenty ##AT##-##AT## third day of December , in the town of Sharon , Windsor county , State of Vermont . .
4 His family consisting of eleven souls , namely , my father , Joseph Smith ; my a mother , Lucy Smith ( whose name , previous to her marriage , was Mack , daughter of Solomon Mack ) ; my brothers , b Alvin ( who died November 19th , 1823 , in the 26th year of his age ) , c Hyrum , myself , d Samuel Harrison , William , Don Carlos ; and my sisters , Sophronia , Catherine , and Lucy .
5 Some time in the second year after our removal to Manchester , there was in the place where we lived an unusual excitement on the subject of religion .
It commenced with the Methodists , but soon became general among all the sects in that region of country .
Indeed , the whole district of country seemed affected by it , and great multitudes united themselves to the different religious parties , which created no small stir and division amongst the people , some crying , “ a Lo , here ! ” and others , “ Lo , there ! ” Some were contending for the Methodist faith , some for the Presbyterian , and some for the Baptist .
7 I was at this time in my fifteenth year .
My father ’ s family was proselyted to the Presbyterian faith , and four of them joined that church , namely , my mother , Lucy ; my brothers Hyrum and Samuel Harrison ; and my sister Sophronia .
8 During this time of great excitement my mind was called up to serious reflection and great uneasiness ; but though my feelings were deep and often poignant , still I kept myself aloof from all these parties , though I attended their several meetings as often as occasion would permit .
In process of time my mind became somewhat partial to the Methodist sect , and I felt some desire to be united with them ; but so great were the confusion and a strife among the different denominations , that it was impossible for a person young as I was , and so unacquainted with men and things , to come to any certain conclusion who was b right and who was wrong .
9 My mind at times was greatly excited , the cry and tumult were so great and incessant .
The Presbyterians were most decided against the Baptists and Methodists , and used all the powers of both reason and sophistry to prove their errors , or , at least , to make the people think they were in error .
On the other hand , the Baptists and Methodists in their turn were equally zealous in endeavoring to establish their own tenets and disprove all others .
10 In the midst of this war of words and tumult of opinions , I often said to myself : What is to be done ?
Who of all these parties are right ; or , are they all wrong together ?
If any one of them be a right , which is it , and how shall I know it ?
11 While I was laboring under the extreme difficulties caused by the contests of these parties of religionists , I was one day reading the Epistle of a James , first chapter and fifth verse , which reads : If any of you lack b wisdom , let him ask of God , that giveth to all men liberally , and upbraideth not ; and it shall be given him .
12 Never did any passage of a scripture come with more power to the heart of man than this did at this time to mine .
It seemed to enter with great force into every feeling of my heart .
I reflected on it again and again , knowing that if any person needed b wisdom from God , I did ; for how to act I did not know , and unless I could get more wisdom than I then had , I would never know ; for the teachers of religion of the different sects c understood the same passages of scripture so differently as to destroy all confidence in settling the question by an appeal to the Bible .
13 At length I came to the conclusion that I must either remain in a darkness and confusion , or else I must do as James directs , that is , ask of God .
I at length came to the determination to “ ask of God , ” concluding that if he gave wisdom to them that lacked wisdom , and would b give liberally , and not upbraid , I might venture .
14 So , in accordance with this , my determination to ask of God , I retired to the a woods to make the attempt .
It was on the morning of a b beautiful , clear day , early in the spring of eighteen hundred and twenty .
It was the first time in my life that I had made such an attempt , for amidst all my anxieties I had never as yet made the attempt to c pray d vocally .
15 After I had retired to the place where I had previously designed to go , having looked around me , and finding myself alone , I kneeled down and began to offer up the desires of my heart to God .
I had scarcely done so , when immediately I was a seized upon by some power which entirely overcame me , and had such an astonishing influence over me as to bind my tongue so that I could not speak .
Thick b darkness gathered around me , and it seemed to me for a time as if I were doomed to sudden destruction .
17 It no sooner appeared than I found myself a delivered from the enemy which held me bound .
When the light rested upon me I b saw two c Personages , whose brightness and d glory defy all description , e standing above me in the air .
One of them spake unto me , calling me by name and said , pointing to the other — This is My f Beloved g Son .
18 My object in going to a inquire of the Lord was to know which of all the sects was right , that I might know which to join .
No sooner , therefore , did I get possession of myself , so as to be able to speak , than I asked the Personages who stood above me in the light , which of all the sects was right ( for at this time it had never entered into my heart that all were wrong ) — and which I should join .
20 He again forbade me to join with any of them ; and many other things did he say unto me , which I cannot write at this time .
When I came to myself again , I found myself a lying on my back , looking up into heaven .
When the light had departed , I had no strength ; but soon recovering in some degree , I went home .
And as I leaned up to the fireplace , b mother inquired what the matter was .
I replied , “ Never mind , all is well — I am well enough off . ” I then said to my mother , “ I have learned for myself that Presbyterianism is not true . ” It seems as though the c adversary was aware , at a very early period of my life , that I was destined to prove a disturber and an annoyer of his kingdom ; else why should the powers of darkness combine against me ?
Why the d opposition and persecution that arose against me , almost in my infancy ?
Some preachers and other professors of religion reject account of First Vision — Persecution heaped upon Joseph Smith — He testifies of the reality of the vision .
21 Some few days after I had this vision , I happened to be in company with one of the Methodist preachers , who was very active in the before mentioned religious excitement ; and , conversing with him on the subject of religion , I took occasion to give him an account of the vision which I had had .
I was greatly surprised at his behavior ; he treated my communication not only lightly , but with great contempt , saying it was all of the devil , that there were no such things as a visions or b revelations in these days ; that all such things had ceased with the apostles , and that there would never be any more of them .
23 It caused me serious reflection then , and often has since , how very strange it was that an obscure a boy , of a little over fourteen years of age , and one , too , who was doomed to the necessity of obtaining a scanty maintenance by his daily b labor , should be thought a character of sufficient importance to attract the attention of the great ones of the most popular sects of the day , and in a manner to create in them a spirit of the most bitter c persecution and d reviling .
But strange or not , so it was , and it was often the cause of great sorrow to myself .
24 However , it was nevertheless a fact that I had beheld a a vision .
I have thought since , that I felt much like Paul , when he made his defense before King Agrippa , and related the account of the vision he had when he saw a light , and heard a voice ; but still there were but few who believed him ; some said he was dishonest , others said he was b mad ; and he was ridiculed and reviled .
But all this did not destroy the reality of his vision .
He had seen a vision , he knew he had , and all the c persecution under heaven could not make it otherwise ; and though they should persecute him unto death , yet he knew , and would know to his latest breath , that he had both seen a light and heard a voice speaking unto him , and all the world could not make him think or believe otherwise .
25 So it was with me .
I had actually seen a light , and in the midst of that light I saw two a Personages , and they did in reality speak to me ; and though I was b hated and c persecuted for saying that I had seen a vision , yet it was true ; and while they were persecuting me , reviling me , and speaking all manner of evil against me d falsely for so saying , I was led to say in my heart : Why persecute me for telling the truth ?
I have actually seen a vision ; and who am I that I can withstand God , or why does the world think to make me deny what I have actually seen ?
For I had seen a vision ; I knew it , and I knew that God knew it , and I could not e deny it , neither dared I do it ; at least I knew that by so doing I would offend God , and come under condemnation .
26 I had now got my mind satisfied so far as the sectarian world was concerned — that it was not my duty to join with any of them , but to continue as I was until further a directed .
I had found the testimony of James to be true — that a man who lacked wisdom might ask of God , and obtain , and not be b upbraided .
Moroni appears to Joseph Smith — Joseph ’ s name is to be known for good and evil among all nations — Moroni tells him of the Book of Mormon and of the coming judgments of the Lord , and quotes many scriptures — The hiding place of the gold plates is revealed — Moroni continues to instruct the Prophet .
27 I continued to pursue my common vocations in life until the twenty ##AT##-##AT## first of September , one thousand eight hundred and twenty ##AT##-##AT## three , all the time suffering severe persecution at the hands of all classes of men , both religious and irreligious , because I continued to a affirm that I had seen a vision .
In making this confession , no one need suppose me guilty of any great or malignant sins .
A disposition to commit such was never in my nature .
But I was guilty of d levity , and sometimes associated with jovial company , etc . , not consistent with that character which ought to be maintained by one who was e called of God as I had been .
But this will not seem very strange to any one who recollects my youth , and is acquainted with my native f cheery temperament .
30 While I was thus in the act of calling upon God , I discovered a a light appearing in my room , which continued to increase until the room was lighter than at noonday , when immediately a b personage appeared at my bedside , standing in the air , for his feet did not touch the floor .
31 He had on a loose robe of most exquisite a whiteness .
It was a whiteness beyond anything earthly I had ever seen ; nor do I believe that any earthly thing could be made to appear so exceedingly white and brilliant .
His hands were naked , and his arms also , a little above the wrist ; so , also , were his feet naked , as were his legs , a little above the ankles .
His head and neck were also bare .
I could discover that he had no other clothing on but this robe , as it was open , so that I could see into his bosom .
32 Not only was his robe exceedingly white , but his whole person was a glorious beyond description , and his countenance truly like b lightning .
The room was exceedingly light , but not so very bright as immediately around his person .
When I first looked upon him , I was c afraid ; but the d fear soon left me .
33 He called me by a name , and said unto me that he was a b messenger sent from the presence of God to me , and that his name was Moroni ; that God had a work for me to do ; and that my name should be had for c good and evil among all nations , kindreds , and tongues , or that it should be both good and evil spoken of among all people .
34 He said there was a a book deposited , written upon gold plates , giving an account of the former inhabitants of this continent , and the source from whence they sprang .
35 Also , that there were two stones in silver bows — and these stones , fastened to a a breastplate , constituted what is called the b Urim and Thummim — deposited with the plates ; and the possession and use of these stones were what constituted “ c seers ” in ancient or former times ; and that God had prepared them for the purpose of translating the book .
36 After telling me these things , he commenced quoting the prophecies of the Old Testament .
He first quoted part of the third chapter of a Malachi ; and he quoted also the fourth or last chapter of the same prophecy , though with a little variation from the way it reads in our Bibles .
37 For behold , the a day cometh that shall b burn as an oven , and all the proud , yea , and all that do wickedly shall burn as c stubble ; for they that come shall burn them , saith the Lord of Hosts , that it shall leave them neither root nor branch .
38 And again , he quoted the fifth verse thus : Behold , I will reveal unto you the a Priesthood , by the hand of b Elijah the prophet , before the coming of the great and dreadful day of the c Lord .
39 He also quoted the next verse differently : And he shall plant in the hearts of the a children the b promises made to the fathers , and the hearts of the children shall turn to their fathers .
If it were not so , the whole earth would be utterly wasted at his coming .
40 In addition to these , he quoted the eleventh chapter of a Isaiah , saying that it was about to be fulfilled .
He quoted also the third chapter of Acts , twenty ##AT##-##AT## second and twenty ##AT##-##AT## third verses , precisely as they stand in our New Testament .
He said that that b prophet was Christ ; but the day had not yet come when “ they who would not hear his voice should be c cut off from among the people , ” but soon would come .
41 He also quoted the second chapter of a Joel , from the twenty ##AT##-##AT## eighth verse to the last .
He also said that this was not yet fulfilled , but was soon to be .
And he further stated that the fulness of the b Gentiles was soon to come in .
He quoted many other passages of scripture , and offered many explanations which c cannot be mentioned here .
42 Again , he told me , that when I got those plates of which he had spoken — for the time that they should be obtained was not yet fulfilled — I should not show them to any person ; neither the breastplate with the Urim and Thummim ; only to those to whom I should be commanded to show them ; if I did I should be a destroyed .
While he was conversing with me about the plates , the vision was opened to my b mind that I could see the place where the plates were deposited , and that so clearly and distinctly that I knew the place again when I visited it .
43 After this communication , I saw the light in the room begin to gather immediately around the person of him who had been speaking to me , and it continued to do so until the room was again left dark , except just around him ; when , instantly I saw , as it were , a conduit open right up into heaven , and he a ascended till he entirely disappeared , and the room was left as it had been before this heavenly light had made its appearance .
44 I lay musing on the singularity of the scene , and marveling greatly at what had been told to me by this extraordinary messenger ; when , in the midst of my a meditation , I suddenly discovered that my room was again beginning to get lighted , and in an instant , as it were , the same heavenly messenger was again by my bedside .
45 He commenced , and a again related the very same things which he had done at his first visit , without the least variation ; which having done , he informed me of great b judgments which were coming upon the earth , with great desolations by c famine , d sword , and pestilence ; and that these grievous judgments would come on the earth in this generation .
Having related these things , he again ascended as he had done before .
46 By this time , so deep were the impressions made on my mind , that sleep had fled from my eyes , and I lay overwhelmed in a astonishment at what I had both seen and heard .
But what was my surprise when again I beheld the same messenger at my bedside , and heard him rehearse or repeat over again to me the same things as before ; and added a caution to me , telling me that Satan would try to b tempt me ( in consequence of the indigent circumstances of my father ’ s family ) , to get the plates for the purpose of getting c rich .
This he forbade me , saying that I must have no other object in view in getting the plates but to glorify God , and must not be influenced by any other d motive than that of building his kingdom ; otherwise I could not get them .
47 After this third visit , he again ascended into heaven as before , and I was again left to a ponder on the strangeness of what I had just experienced ; when almost immediately after the heavenly messenger had ascended from me for the third time , the cock crowed , and I found that day was approaching , so that our interviews must have occupied the whole of that night .
48 I shortly after arose from my bed , and , as usual , went to the necessary labors of the day ; but , in attempting to work as at other times , I found my a strength so exhausted as to render me entirely unable .
My father , who was laboring along with me , discovered something to be wrong with me , and told me to go home .
I started with the intention of going to the house ; but , in attempting to cross the fence out of the field where we were , my strength entirely failed me , and I b fell helpless on the ground , and for a time was quite unconscious of anything .
49 The first thing that I can recollect was a voice speaking unto me , calling me by name .
I looked up , and beheld the same messenger standing over my head , surrounded by light as before .
He then again related unto me all that he had related to me the previous night , and commanded me to go to my a father and tell him of the vision and commandments which I had received .
50 I obeyed ; I returned to my a father in the field , and rehearsed the whole matter to him .
He b replied to me that it was of God , and told me to go and do as commanded by the messenger .
I left the field , and went to the place where the messenger had told me the plates were deposited ; and owing to the distinctness of the vision which I had had concerning it , I knew the place the instant that I arrived there .
51 Convenient to the village of Manchester , Ontario county , New York , stands a a hill of considerable size , and the most elevated of any in the neighborhood .
On the west side of this hill , not far from the top , under a stone of considerable size , lay the plates , deposited in a stone box .
This stone was thick and rounding in the middle on the upper side , and thinner towards the edges , so that the middle part of it was visible above the ground , but the edge all around was covered with earth .
52 Having removed the earth , I obtained a lever , which I got fixed under the edge of the stone , and with a little exertion raised it up .
I looked in , and there indeed did I behold the a plates , the b Urim and Thummim , and the breastplate , as stated by the messenger .
The box in which they lay was formed by laying stones together in some kind of cement .
In the bottom of the box were laid two stones crossways of the box , and on these stones lay the plates and the other things with them .
53 I made an attempt to take them out , but was forbidden by the messenger , and was again informed that the time for bringing them forth had not yet arrived , neither would it , until four years from that time ; but he told me that I should come to that place precisely in one year from that time , and that he would there meet with me , and that I should continue to do so until the time should come for obtaining the plates .
54 Accordingly , as I had been commanded , I went at the end of each year , and at each time I found the same messenger there , and received instruction and intelligence from him at each of our interviews , respecting what the Lord was going to do , and how and in what manner his a kingdom was to be conducted in the last days .
Joseph Smith marries Emma Hale — He receives the gold plates from Moroni and translates some of the characters — Martin Harris shows characters and translation to Professor Anthon , who says : “ I cannot read a sealed book . ” ( Verses 55 ##AT##-##AT## 65 .
55 As my father ’ s worldly circumstances were very limited , we were under the necessity of a laboring with our hands , hiring out by day ’ s work and otherwise , as we could get opportunity .
Sometimes we were at home , and sometimes abroad , and by continuous b labor were enabled to get a comfortable maintenance .
56 In the year 1823 my father ’ s family met with a great a affliction by the death of my eldest brother , b Alvin .
In the month of October , 1825 , I hired with an old gentleman by the name of Josiah Stoal , who lived in Chenango county , State of New York .
He had heard something of a silver mine having been opened by the Spaniards in Harmony , Susquehanna county , State of Pennsylvania ; and had , previous to my hiring to him , been digging , in order , if possible , to discover the mine .
After I went to live with him , he took me , with the rest of his hands , to dig for the silver mine , at which I continued to work for nearly a month , without success in our undertaking , and finally I prevailed with the old gentleman to cease digging after it .
Hence arose the very prevalent story of my having been a money ##AT##-##AT## digger .
57 During the time that I was thus employed , I was put to board with a Mr. Isaac Hale , of that place ; it was there I first saw my wife ( his daughter ) , Emma Hale .
On the 18th of January , 1827 , we were married , while I was yet employed in the service of Mr. Stoal .
58 Owing to my continuing to assert that I had seen a vision , a persecution still followed me , and my wife ’ s father ’ s family were very much opposed to our being married .
I was , therefore , under the necessity of taking her elsewhere ; so we went and were married at the house of Squire Tarbill , in South Bainbridge , Chenango county , New York .
Immediately after my marriage , I left Mr. Stoal ’ s , and went to my father ’ s , and b farmed with him that season .
59 At length the time arrived for obtaining the plates , the Urim and Thummim , and the breastplate .
60 I soon found out the reason why I had received such strict charges to keep them safe , and why it was that the messenger had said that when I had done what was required at my hand , he would call for them .
For no sooner was it known that I had them , than the most strenuous exertions were used to a get them from me .
Every stratagem that could be invented was resorted to for that purpose .
The persecution became more bitter and severe than before , and multitudes were on the alert continually to get them from me if possible .
But by the wisdom of God , they remained safe in my hands , until I had accomplished by them what was required at my hand .
When , according to arrangements , the messenger called for them , I delivered them up to him ; and he has them in his charge until this b day , being the second day of May , one thousand eight hundred and thirty ##AT##-##AT## eight .
61 The excitement , however , still continued , and rumor with her thousand tongues was all the time employed in circulating a falsehoods about my father ’ s family , and about myself .
If I were to relate a thousandth part of them , it would fill up volumes .
The persecution , however , became so intolerable that I was under the necessity of leaving Manchester , and going with my wife to Susquehanna county , in the State of Pennsylvania .
While preparing to start — being very poor , and the persecution so heavy upon us that there was no probability that we would ever be otherwise — in the midst of our afflictions we found a friend in a gentleman by the name of b Martin Harris , who came to us and gave me fifty dollars to assist us on our journey .
Mr. Harris was a resident of Palmyra township , Wayne county , in the State of New York , and a farmer of respectability .
62 By this timely aid was I enabled to reach the place of my destination in Pennsylvania ; and immediately after my arrival there I commenced copying the characters off the plates .
I copied a considerable number of them , and by means of the a Urim and Thummim I translated some of them , which I did between the time I arrived at the house of my wife ’ s father , in the month of December , and the February following .
63 Sometime in this month of February , the aforementioned Mr. Martin Harris came to our place , got the characters which I had drawn off the plates , and started with them to the city of New York .
64 “ I went to the city of New York , and presented the characters which had been translated , with the translation thereof , to Professor Charles Anthon , a gentleman celebrated for his literary attainments .
Professor Anthon stated that the translation was correct , more so than any he had before seen translated from the Egyptian .
I then showed him those which were not yet translated , and he said that they were Egyptian , Chaldaic , Assyriac , and Arabic ; and he said they were true characters .
He gave me a certificate , certifying to the people of Palmyra that they were true characters , and that the translation of such of them as had been translated was also correct .
I took the certificate and put it into my pocket , and was just leaving the house , when Mr. Anthon called me back , and asked me how the young man found out that there were gold plates in the place where he found them .
I answered that an angel of God had revealed it unto him .
65 “ He then said to me , ‘ Let me see that certificate . ’ I accordingly took it out of my pocket and gave it to him , when he took it and tore it to pieces , saying that there was no such thing now as ministering of a angels , and that if I would bring the plates to him he would translate them .
I informed him that part of the plates were b sealed , and that I was forbidden to bring them .
Oliver Cowdery serves as scribe in translating the Book of Mormon — Joseph and Oliver receive the Aaronic Priesthood from John the Baptist — They are baptized , ordained , and receive the spirit of prophecy .
66 On the 5th day of April , 1829 , a Oliver Cowdery came to my house , until which time I had never seen him .
He stated to me that having been teaching school in the neighborhood where my father resided , and my father being one of those who sent to the school , he went to board for a season at his house , and while there the family related to him the circumstances of my having received the plates , and accordingly he had come to make inquiries of me .
67 Two days after the arrival of Mr. Cowdery ( being the 7th of April ) I commenced to translate the Book of Mormon , and he began to a write for me .
68 We still continued the work of translation , when , in the ensuing month ( May , 1829 ) , we on a certain day went into the woods to pray and inquire of the Lord respecting a baptism for the b remission of sins , that we found mentioned in the translation of the plates .
69 Upon you my fellow servants , in the name of Messiah , I confer the a Priesthood of b Aaron , which holds the keys of the ministering of angels , and of the gospel of repentance , and of c baptism by immersion for the remission of sins ; and this shall never be taken again from the earth until the sons of d Levi do offer again an offering unto the Lord in e righteousness .
70 He said this Aaronic Priesthood had not the power of laying on hands for the gift of the Holy Ghost , but that this should be conferred on us hereafter ; and he commanded us to go and be baptized , and gave us directions that I should baptize Oliver Cowdery , and that afterwards he should baptize me .
71 Accordingly we went and were baptized .
I a baptized him first , and afterwards he baptized me — after which I laid my hands upon his head and ordained him to the Aaronic Priesthood , and afterwards he laid his hands on me and ordained me to the same Priesthood — for so we were commanded .
It was on the fifteenth day of May , 1829 , that we were ordained under the hand of this messenger , and baptized .
73 Immediately on our coming up out of the water after we had been baptized , we experienced great and glorious blessings from our Heavenly Father .
No sooner had I baptized Oliver Cowdery , than the Holy Ghost fell upon him , and he stood up and a prophesied many things which should shortly come to pass .
And again , so soon as I had been baptized by him , I also had the spirit of prophecy , when , standing up , I prophesied concerning the rise of this Church , and many other things connected with the Church , and this generation of the children of men .
We were filled with the Holy Ghost , and rejoiced in the God of our salvation .
74 Our minds being now enlightened , we began to have the a scriptures laid open to our understandings , and the b true meaning and intention of their more c mysterious passages revealed unto us in a manner which we never could attain to previously , nor ever before had thought of .
In the meantime we were forced to keep secret the circumstances of having received the Priesthood and our having been baptized , owing to a spirit of persecution which had already manifested itself in the neighborhood .
75 We had been threatened with being mobbed , from time to time , and this , too , by professors of religion .
And their intentions of mobbing us were only counteracted by the influence of my wife ’ s father ’ s family ( under Divine providence ) , who had become very a friendly to me , and who were opposed to mobs , and were willing that I should be allowed to continue the work of translation without interruption ; and therefore offered and promised us protection from all unlawful proceedings , as far as in them lay .
King Benjamin continues his address — The Lord Omnipotent shall minister among men in a tabernacle of clay — Blood shall come from every pore as he atones for the sins of the world — His is the only name whereby salvation comes — Men can put off the natural man and become saints through the atonement — The torment of the wicked shall be as a lake of fire and brimstone .
1 And again my brethren , I would call your attention , for I have somewhat more to speak unto you ; for behold , I have things to tell you concerning that which is to come .
2 And the things which I shall tell you are made known unto me by an a angel from God .
And he said unto me : b Awake ; and I awoke , and behold he stood before me .
3 And he said unto me : Awake , and hear the words which I shall tell thee ; for behold , I am come to declare unto you the a glad tidings of great b joy .
4 For the Lord hath heard thy prayers , and hath judged of thy a righteousness , and hath sent me to declare unto thee that thou mayest rejoice ; and that thou mayest declare unto thy people , that they may also be filled with joy .
6 And he shall cast out a devils , or the b evil spirits which dwell in the hearts of the children of men .
7 And lo , he shall a suffer b temptations , and pain of body , c hunger , thirst , and fatigue , even more than man can d suffer , except it be unto death ; for behold , e blood cometh from every pore , so great shall be his f anguish for the wickedness and the abominations of his people .
8 And he shall be called a Jesus b Christ , the c Son of God , the d Father of heaven and earth , the e Creator of all things from the beginning ; and his f mother shall be called Mary .
9 And lo , he cometh unto his own , that a salvation might come unto the children of men even through b faith on his name ; and even after all this they shall consider him a man , and say that he hath a c devil , and shall d scourge him , and shall e crucify him .
10 And he shall a rise the b third day from the dead ; and behold , he standeth to c judge the world ; and behold , all these things are done that a righteous judgment might come upon the children of men .
11 For behold , and also his a blood b atoneth for the sins of those who have c fallen by the transgression of Adam , who have died not knowing the d will of God concerning them , or who have e ignorantly sinned .
12 But wo , wo unto him who knoweth that he a rebelleth against God !
For salvation cometh to none such except it be through repentance and faith on the b Lord Jesus Christ .
13 And the Lord God hath sent his holy a prophets among all the children of men , to declare these things to every kindred , nation , and tongue , that thereby whosoever should believe that Christ should come , the same might receive b remission of their sins , and rejoice with exceedingly great joy , even c as though he had already come among them .
14 Yet the Lord God saw that his people were a a stiffnecked people , and he appointed unto them a b law , even the c law of Moses .
15 And many signs , and wonders , and a types , and shadows showed he unto them , concerning his coming ; and also holy prophets spake unto them concerning his coming ; and yet they b hardened their hearts , and understood not that the c law of Moses availeth nothing d except it were through the e atonement of his blood .
16 And even if it were possible that little a children could sin they could not be saved ; but I say unto you they are b blessed ; for behold , as in Adam , or by nature , they fall , even so the blood of Christ c atoneth for their sins .
17 And moreover , I say unto you , that there shall be a no other name given nor any other way nor means whereby b salvation can come unto the children of men , only in and through the name of Christ , the c Lord Omnipotent .
18 For behold he judgeth , and his judgment is just ; and the infant perisheth not that dieth in his infancy ; but men drink a damnation to their own souls except they humble themselves and b become as little children , and believe that c salvation was , and is , and is to come , in and through the d atoning blood of Christ , the Lord Omnipotent .
20 And moreover , I say unto you , that the time shall come when the a knowledge of a b Savior shall spread throughout c every nation , kindred , tongue , and people .
21 And behold , when that time cometh , none shall be found a blameless before God , except it be little children , only through repentance and faith on the name of the Lord God Omnipotent .
22 And even at this time , when thou shalt have taught thy people the things which the Lord thy God hath commanded thee , even then are they found no more blameless in the sight of God , only according to the words which I have spoken unto thee .
23 And now I have spoken the words which the Lord God hath commanded me .
24 And thus saith the Lord : They shall stand as a bright testimony against this people , at the judgment day ; whereof they shall be judged , every man according to his a works , whether they be good , or whether they be evil .
25 And if they be evil they are consigned to an awful a view of their own guilt and abominations , which doth cause them to shrink from the presence of the Lord into a state of b misery and c endless torment , from whence they can no more return ; therefore they have drunk damnation to their own souls .
26 Therefore , they have drunk out of the a cup of the wrath of God , which justice could no more deny unto them than it could deny that b Adam should fall because of his partaking of the forbidden c fruit ; therefore , d mercy could have claim on them no more forever .
27 And their a torment is as a b lake of fire and brimstone , whose flames are unquenchable , and whose smoke ascendeth up c forever and ever .
Thus hath the Lord commanded me .

Matter in the universe is not distributed randomly .
Galaxies , quasars , and intergalactic gas outline a pattern that has been compared to soap bubbles - large voids surrounded by thin walls of galaxies , with dense galactic clusters where walls intersect .
One of the primary goals of the SDSS is to map this structure in great detail , out to large distances .
Scientists have many theories about how the universe evolved , and the theories predict different different large ##AT##-##AT## scale structrues for the universe .
The SDSS &apos;s map may tell us which theories are right - or whether we will have to come up with entirely new ideas .
Galaxies are usually found near each other , in galactic clusters .
The distribution of these clusters , and how this distribution evolves with time , are important tests of cosmological models : for instance , different cosmological models predict different numbers of galaxy clusters at different redshifts .
Additionally , not only are galaxies clustered , but the clusters themselves are clustered !
The degree to which both galaxies and clusters tend to group together is also a test of different theories .
By studying the masses , distributions , and evolution of galaxy clusters , we can learn something about the formation of mass in the universe : a fundamental goal of cosmology .
Because galaxy clusters can be very massive ( up to 1014 times the mass of the Sun ) , their gravity is strong enough to hold on to extremely hot gas , with temperatures of millions of degrees .
This gas emits radiation at X ##AT##-##AT## ray wavelengths , which can be observed by X ##AT##-##AT## ray satellites like Chandra , ROSAT , and XMM .
These satellites have shown that a large fraction of clusters have structure and complicated internal motions , which indicate that they are still evolving .
Also , satellite observations have shown that the X ##AT##-##AT## ray emitting gas comprises the largest fraction of the visible mass in clusters , greater than the sum of all the galaxies .
This is a very interesting result - remember that galaxy clusters were discovered as overdensities of galaxies , and now we know that galaxies are but a small part of the total mass of clusters .
Some astronomers have even suggested clusters without galaxies may also exist - just huge clumps of gas .
Galaxy clusters have huge mass , and the Theory of General Relativity says massive objects bend light as it passes by them , a phenomenon known as gravitational lensing .
The amount of lensing caused by a galaxy cluster depends on the cluster &apos;s total mass , so by measuring the amount of lensing , we can weigh the clusters .
These measurements can be compared to other mass estimates , like the amount of X ##AT##-##AT## ray gas and the velocities of galaxies in the cluster .
With these mass estimates , we can compute the mass ##AT##-##AT## to ##AT##-##AT## light ( M / L ) ratios for clusters . This ratio allows us to estimate the bias , which tells us how galaxies are distributed relative to the rest of the matter .
The M / L ratios also help put constraints on the total mass in the universe .
If we add up the mass of the galaxies that we can see , plus the mass of X ##AT##-##AT## ray gas we have observed , and compare it to the total mass estimated for the cluster , we find that most of the matter is in some other form !
This extra mass is called dark matter because it does not emit light . In fact , it turns out that most of the universe seems to be made of dark matter , which we can &apos;t see directly , but whose existence we can infer due to its gravity .
Scientists have several theories about what dark matter could be , but no one knows for sure .
The discovery of dark matter is one of the greatest and most intriguing discoveries of the last decade .
Most elliptical and S0 galaxies are found in clusters , and more such galaxies are found in denser clusters .
Amazingly , astronomers do not have good explanations for why most clusters contain elliptical galaxies .
They also have a poor understanding of how galaxies in clusters evolve .
We know that there are apparently more blue galaxies in clusters as we look back in time , suggesting that there used to be more star formation .
Yet , we also see clusters with significant numbers of old , red galaxies even at redshifts of about 1 , when the universe was only a few billion years old .
Using the SDSS , we will be able to study these the types and masses of galaxies in thousands of clusters , far more than have ever been studied before .
Superclusters are simply clusters of galaxy clusters .
Whereas clusters are typically found in the filaments and walls of the universe &apos;s &quot; soap bubble , &quot; superclusters are at the intersections of the walls . Superclusters are the largest known structures in the universe , with some as large as 200,000,000 light ##AT##-##AT## years !
However , because these structures are very rare , only a few are known . The most famous superclusters are nearby , including the Great Wall and the Perseus ##AT##-##AT## Pisces supercluster .
There has been recent evidence for superclusters at redshifts of about 1 , which places important constraints on structure formation and cosmological models .
Additionally , the M / L ratios of superclusters are similar to those of clusters . This discovery implies that the mysterious dark matter cannot contribute more to the mass of the universe than it contributes to the mass of clusters .

Not to be believed , Apple and telephone operators have begun blocking Skype on the iPhone , really incredible .
And then they have been 2 million downloads of the software is quite likely that their calls have fallen , so cheap that it is Skype , and even for free between users .
That disappointment turned out to be Apple , I can understand that operators robofonía do , but I think Apple should not have accepted it , ever , ever , but well , I have no other to destroy my iPhone .
Already available in an update of the best players , the iTunes version 8.1.1 on , with some advantages as a carrier for the rental of movies in HD , in addition to patch some bugs related to the synchronization of the iPhone and iPod touch and VoiceOver functionality .
Our friends from engadget has made a video where we see the inside of the latest Mac Pro , mac this really beautiful , I think it is undoubtedly one of the best designs that can exist , but I already ordered one .

Alfred Abel ( 12 March 1879 – 12 December 1937 ) was a German film actor , director , and producer . He appeared in over 140 silent and sound films between 1913 and 1938 .
Abel is also known as the “ Lewis Stone of German films . ” &#91; 1 &#93; His most famous performance is his role as Joh Fredersen in Fritz Lang &apos; s 1927 film Metropolis .
The Bauhaus school was founded by Walter Gropius in Weimar . In spite of its name , and the fact that its founder was an architect , the Bauhaus did not have an architecture department during the first years of its existence .
Nonetheless it was founded with the idea of creating a &apos; total &apos; work of art in which all arts , including architecture would eventually be brought together .
The Bauhaus style became one of the most influential currents in Modernist architecture and modern design .
&#91; 1 &#93; The Bauhaus had a profound influence upon subsequent developments in art , architecture , graphic design , interior design , industrial design , and typography .
The school existed in three German cities ( Weimar from 1919 to 1925 , Dessau from 1925 to 1932 and Berlin from 1932 to 1933 ) , under three different architect ##AT##-##AT## directors : Walter Gropius from 1919 to 1927 , Hannes Meyer from 1927 to 1930 and Ludwig Mies van der Rohe from 1930 until 1933 , when the school was closed by the Nazi regime .
The changes of venue and leadership resulted in a constant shifting of focus , technique , instructors , and politics . For instance : the pottery shop was discontinued when the school moved from Weimar to Dessau , even though it had been an important revenue source ; when Mies van der Rohe took over the school in 1930 , he transformed it into a private school , and would not allow any supporters of Hannes Meyer to attend it .
However , the most important influence on Bauhaus was modernism , a cultural movement whose origins lay as far back as the 1880s , and which had already made its presence felt in Germany before the World War , despite the prevailing conservatism .
The design innovations commonly associated with Gropius and the Bauhaus - the radically simplified forms , the rationality and functionality , and the idea that mass ##AT##-##AT## production was reconcilable with the individual artistic spirit - were already partly developed in Germany before the Bauhaus was founded .
The German national designers &apos; organization Deutscher Werkbund was formed in 1907 by Hermann Muthesius to harness the new potentials of mass production , with a mind towards preserving Germany &apos;s economic competitiveness with England .
In its first seven years , the Werkbund came to be regarded as the authoritative body on questions of design in Germany , and was copied in other countries . Many fundamental questions of craftsmanship vs. mass production , the relationship of usefulness and beauty , the practical purpose of formal beauty in a commonplace object , and whether or not a single proper form could exist , were argued out among its 1870 members ( by 1914 ) .
The entire movement of German architectural modernism was known as Neues Bauen .
Beginning in June 1907 , Peter Behrens &apos; pioneering industrial design work for the German electrical company AEG successfully integrated art and mass production on a large scale .
He designed consumer products , standardized parts , created clean ##AT##-##AT## lined designs for the company &apos;s graphics , developed a consistent corporate identity , built the modernist landmark AEG Turbine Factory , and made full use of newly developed materials such as poured concrete and exposed steel .
Behrens was a founding member of the Werkbund , and both Walter Gropius and Adolf Meier worked for him in this period .
The Bauhaus was founded at a time when the German zeitgeist ( &quot; spirit of the times &quot; ) had turned from emotional Expressionism to the matter ##AT##-##AT## of ##AT##-##AT## fact New Objectivity . An entire group of working architects , including Erich Mendelsohn , Bruno Taut and Hans Poelzig , turned away from fanciful experimentation , and turned toward rational , functional , sometimes standardized building .
Beyond the Bauhaus , many other significant German ##AT##-##AT## speaking architects in the 1920s responded to the same aesthetic issues and material possibilities as the school . They also responded to the promise of a &quot; minimal dwelling &quot; written into the new Weimar Constitution .
Ernst May , Bruno Taut , and Martin Wagner , among others , built large housing blocks in Frankfurt and Berlin . The acceptance of modernist design into everyday life was the subject of publicity campaigns , well ##AT##-##AT## attended public exhibitions like the Weissenhof Estate , films , and sometimes fierce public debate .
&#91; 9 &#93; In the pamphlet for an April 1919 exhibition entitled &quot; Exhibition of Unknown Architects &quot; , Gropius proclaimed his goal as being &quot; to create a new guild of craftsmen , without the class distinctions which raise an arrogant barrier between craftsman and artist . &quot; Gropius &apos; neologism Bauhaus references both building and the Bauhütte , a premodern guild of stonemasons .
&#91; 10 &#93; The early intention was for the Bauhaus to be a combined architecture school , crafts school , and academy of the arts . In 1919 Swiss painter Johannes Itten , German ##AT##-##AT## American painter Lyonel Feininger , and German sculptor Gerhard Marcks , along with Gropius , comprised the faculty of the Bauhaus .
Gropius &apos;s design for the Dessau facilities was a return to the futuristic Gropius of 1914 that had more in common with the International style lines of the Fagus Factory than the stripped down Neo ##AT##-##AT## classical of the Werkbund pavilion or the Völkisch Sommerfeld House . &#91; 15 &#93; The Dessau years saw a remarkable change in direction for the school .
Meyer became director when Gropius resigned in February 1928 , and brought the Bauhaus its two most significant building commissions , both of which still exist : five apartment buildings in the city of Dessau , and the headquarters of the Federal School of the German Trade Unions ( ADGB ) in Bernau .
Meyer favored measurements and calculations in his presentations to clients , along with the use of off ##AT##-##AT## the ##AT##-##AT## shelf architectural components to reduce costs , and this approach proved attractive to potential clients .
The school turned its first profit under his leadership in 1929 .
But Meyer also generated a great deal of conflict .
As a radical functionalist , he had no patience with the aesthetic program , and forced the resignations of Herbert Bayer , Marcel Breuer , and other long ##AT##-##AT## time instructors .
As a vocal Communist , he encouraged the formation of a communist student organization .
In the increasingly dangerous political atmosphere , this became a threat to the existence of the Dessau school .
Meyer was also compromised by a sexual scandal involving one of his students , and Gropius fired him in 1930 .
The paradox of the early Bauhaus was that , although its manifesto proclaimed that the ultimate aim of all creative activity was building , the school did not offer classes in architecture until 1927 .
The single most profitable tangible product of the Bauhaus was its wallpaper .
During the years under Gropius ( 1919 – 1927 ) , he and his partner Adolf Meyer observed no real distinction between the output of his architectural office and the school .
So the built output of Bauhaus architecture in these years is the output of Gropius : the Sommerfeld house in Berlin , the Otte house in Berlin , the Auerbach house in Jena , and the competition design for the Chicago Tribune Tower , which brought the school much attention . The definitive 1926 Bauhaus building in Dessau is also attributed to Gropius .
In the next two years under Meyer , the architectural focus shifted away from aesthetics and towards functionality .
There were major commissions : one from the city of Dessau for five tightly designed &quot; Laubenganghäuser &quot; ( apartment buildings with balcony access ) , which are still in use today , and another for the headquarters of the Federal School of the German Trade Unions ( ADGB ) in Bernau bei Berlin . Meyer &apos;s approach was to research users &apos; needs and scientifically develop the design solution .
Mies van der Rohe repudiated Meyer &apos;s politics , his supporters , and his architectural approach .
As opposed to Gropius &apos;s &quot; study of essentials &quot; , and Meyer &apos;s research into user requirements , Mies advocated a &quot; spatial implementation of intellectual decisions &quot; , which effectively meant an adoption of his own aesthetics .
Neither van der Rohe nor his Bauhaus students saw any projects built during the 1930s .
The popular conception of the Bauhaus as the source of extensive Weimar ##AT##-##AT## era working housing is not accurate . Two projects , the apartment building project in Dessau and the Törten row housing also in Dessau , fall in that category , but developing worker housing was not the first priority of Gropius nor Mies .
The Bauhaus had a major impact on art and architecture trends in Western Europe , the United States , Canada and Israel ( particularly in White City , Tel Aviv ) in the decades following its demise , as many of the artists involved fled , or were exiled , by the Nazi regime .
Tel Aviv , in fact , has been named to the list of world heritage sites by the UN due to its abundance of Bauhaus architecture in 2004 &#91; 17 &#93; &#91; 18 &#93; ; it had some 4000 Bauhaus buildings erected from 1933 on .
In the late 1930s , Mies van der Rohe re ##AT##-##AT## settled in Chicago , enjoyed the sponsorship of the influential Philip Johnson , and became one of the pre ##AT##-##AT## eminent architects in the world . Moholy ##AT##-##AT## Nagy also went to Chicago and founded the New Bauhaus school under the sponsorship of industrialist and philanthropist Walter Paepcke .
Herbert Bayer , sponsored by Paepcke , moved to Aspen , Colorado in support of Paepcke &apos;s Aspen projects at the Aspen Institute . In 1953 , Max Bill , together with Inge Aicher ##AT##-##AT## Scholl and Otl Aicher , founded the Ulm School of Design ( German : Hochschule für Gestaltung - HfG Ulm ) in Ulm , Germany , a design school in the tradition of the Bauhaus .
One of the main objectives of the Bauhaus was to unify art , craft , and technology . The machine was considered a positive element , and therefore industrial and product design were important components .
Vorkurs ( &quot; initial &quot; or &quot; preliminary course &quot; ) was taught ; this is the modern day &quot; Basic Design &quot; course that has become one of the key foundational courses offered in architectural and design schools across the globe . There was no teaching of history in the school because everything was supposed to be designed and created according to first principles rather than by following precedent .
One of the most important contributions of the Bauhaus is in the field of modern furniture design . The ubiquitous Cantilever chair by Dutch designer Mart Stam , using the tensile properties of steel , and the Wassily Chair designed by Marcel Breuer are two examples .
After German reunification , a reorganized school continued in the same building , with no essential continuity with the Bauhaus under Gropius in the early 1920s &#91; 20 &#93; . In 1979 Bauhaus ##AT##-##AT## Dessau College started to organize postgraduate programs with participants from all over the world .
American art schools have also rediscovered the Bauhaus school .
The Master Craftsman Program at Florida State University bases its artistic philosophy on Bauhaus theory and practice .

Edward Benjamin Britten , Baron Britten , OM CH ( 22 November 1913 – 4 December 1976 ) was an English composer , conductor , violist and pianist .
Britten was born in Lowestoft , Suffolk , the son of a dentist and a talented amateur musician . He showed musical gifts very early in life , and began composing prolifically as a child .
He was educated at Old Buckenham Hall School in Suffolk , an all ##AT##-##AT## boys prep school , and Gresham &apos;s School , Holt .
In 1927 , he began private lessons with Frank Bridge ; he also studied , less happily , at the Royal College of Music under John Ireland , with some input from Ralph Vaughan Williams .
Although ultimately held back by his parents ( at the suggestion of College staff ) , Britten had also intended to study with Alban Berg in Vienna . Britten was a prolific juvenile composer ; some 800 works and fragments precede his early published works .
His first compositions to attract wide attention , however , were the Sinfonietta Op. 1 , &quot; A Hymn to the Virgin &quot; ( 1930 ) and a set of choral variations A Boy was Born , written in 1934 for the BBC Singers .
In April 1935 , he was approached by the film director Alberto Cavalcanti to write the film score for the documentary The King &apos;s Stamp , produced by the GPO Film Unit . &#91; 1 &#93; He subsequently met W. H. Auden , who was also working for the GPO Film Unit : together they worked on the films Coal Face and Night Mail .
Of more lasting importance to Britten was his meeting in 1937 with the tenor Peter Pears , who was to become his musical collaborator and inspiration as well as his life partner . In the same year he composed a Pacifist March ( words , Ronald Duncan ) for the Peace Pledge Union , of which , as a pacifist , he had become an active member , but the work was not a success and soon withdrawn .
One of Britten &apos;s most noteworthy works from the 1930s was Variations on a Theme of Frank Bridge for string orchestra , Op.
There , in 1940 , Britten composed Seven Sonnets of Michelangelo , the first of many song cycles for Pears . Already friends with the composer Aaron Copland , Britten encountered his latest works Billy the Kid and An Outdoor Overture , both of which manifestly influenced his own music .
&#91; 3 &#93; While in America Britten wrote his first music drama , Paul Bunyan , an operetta ( to a libretto by Auden ) . The period in America was also remarkable for a number of orchestral works , including the Violin Concerto Op.
Peter Grimes was the first in a series of English operas , of which Billy Budd ( 1951 ) and The Turn of the Screw ( 1954 ) were particularly admired .
His Shakespeare opera , A Midsummer Night &apos;s Dream , followed in 1960 . These operas share common themes .
For example , most feature an &apos; outsider &apos; character , who is excluded or misunderstood by society . Often this is the eponymous protagonist , as in Peter Grimes and Owen Wingrave .
An increasingly important influence was the music of the East , an interest that was fostered by a tour with Pears in 1957 , when Britten was struck by the music of the Balinese gamelan and by Japanese Noh plays .
The fruits of this tour include the ballet The Prince of the Pagodas ( 1957 ) and the series of semi ##AT##-##AT## operatic &quot; Parables for Church Performance &quot; : Curlew River ( 1964 ) , The Burning Fiery Furnace ( 1966 ) and The Prodigal Son ( 1968 ) .
The greatest success of Britten &apos;s career was , however , the musically more conventional War Requiem , written for the 1962 consecration of the newly reconstructed Coventry Cathedral .
Britten developed close friendships with the Russians Dmitri Shostakovich and Mstislav Rostropovich in the 1960s : he composed his Cello Suites , Cello Symphony and Cello Sonata for the latter , and conducted the first Western performance of the former &apos;s Fourteenth Symphony . Shostakovich dedicated this score to Britten , and often spoke very highly of his music .
Britten himself had previously dedicated &apos; The Prodigal Son &apos; ( the third and last of the &apos; Church Parables &apos; ) to Shostakovich . He was honoured again by appointment to the Order of Merit ( OM ) on 23 March 1965 .
In his last decade or so , Britten suffered from increasingly poor health . His late works became progressively more sparse in texture .
They include the operas Owen Wingrave ( 1970 ) and Death in Venice ( 1971 ##AT##-##AT## 3 ) , the Suite on English Folk Tunes &quot; A Time There Was &quot; ( 1974 ) and Third String Quartet ( 1975 ) — which drew on material from Death in Venice — as well as the dramatic cantata Phaedra ( 1975 ) , written for Janet Baker .
Having previously declined a knighthood , Britten accepted a life peerage on 2 July 1976 as Baron Britten , of Aldeburgh in the County of Suffolk .
&#91; 6 &#93; A few months later he died of heart failure at his house in Aldeburgh . He is buried in the churchyard of St. Peter and St. Paul &apos;s Church there .
The grave of his partner , Sir Peter Pears lies next to his , close to the grave of Imogen Holst , a close friend .
Britten was an accomplished pianist , frequently performing chamber music and accompanying lieder and song recitals . However , apart from the Holiday Diary ( 1934 ) , Piano Concerto ( 1938 ) , Young Apollo ( 1939 ) , Diversions ( written for Paul Wittgenstein in 1940 ) , Scottish Ballad ( 1941 ) , he wrote relatively little music that puts the piano in the spotlight , and in a 1963 interview for the BBC said that he thought of it as &quot; a background instrument &quot; .

David Hackett Souter ( pronounced / ˈsuːtər / ; born September 17 , 1939 ) served as an Associate Justice of the Supreme Court of the United States from 1990 until his retirement from the Court effective June 29 , 2009 .
Souter was born in Melrose , Massachusetts , September 17 , 1939 .
He is the only child of Joseph Alexander Souter ( 1904 – 1976 ) and Helen Adams Hackett Souter ( 1907 – 1995 ) .
&#91; 3 &#93; &#91; 4 &#93; After moving from Melrose at the age of 11 , he spent most of his childhood and adolescence at his family &apos;s farm in Weare , New Hampshire .
&#91; 3 &#93; He attended Concord High School in New Hampshire .
He went on to Harvard College , from which he received his A.B. , concentrating in philosophy and writing a senior thesis on the legal positivism of Oliver Wendell Holmes , Jr . , the famous Supreme Court justice .
In 1961 , he graduated from Harvard magna cum laude as a member of Phi Beta Kappa . He was selected as a Rhodes Scholar and earned an M.A.
from Magdalen College , Oxford , in 1963 . He then entered Harvard Law School , graduating in 1966 .
Souter worked as an associate at Orr &amp; Reno in Concord , New Hampshire , from 1966 to 1968 ; he disliked private practice .
&#91; 3 &#93; He accepted a position as an Assistant Attorney General of New Hampshire in 1968 , beginning his lifelong career in public service .
As Assistant Attorney General he worked in the criminal division , prosecuting cases in the courts .
In 1971 , Warren Rudman , then the Attorney General of New Hampshire , selected him to be the Deputy Attorney General .
Warren Rudman , who had since been elected a senator , and former New Hampshire Governor John H. Sununu , then chief of staff to President George H. W. Bush , were instrumental in both his nomination and his confirmation to the Supreme Court .
Prior to Sununu &apos;s recommendation , few observers outside of New Hampshire knew who Souter was , &#91; 5 &#93; although he had been mentioned by The New York Times as one of Reagan &apos;s four top nominees for the Supreme Court slot that eventually went to Anthony Kennedy .
Bush originally wanted to appoint Clarence Thomas to Brennan &apos;s seat , but ultimately decided that Thomas did not have enough experience as a federal judge and decided to recommend Souter for the post instead .
Souter , along with former Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist and Justice Stephen Breyer , has a reputation for being a strong guardian of the Court &apos;s institutional integrity .
&#91; citation needed &#93; &#91; clarification needed &#93; A traditionalist in this regard , he stated in response to proposals to videotape oral arguments before the Supreme Court : &quot; I can tell you the day you see a camera come into our courtroom , it &apos;s going to roll over my dead body .
On April 30 , 2009 , NPR reported that Justice Souter planned to retire at the end of the October 2008 term of the court , in June 2009 , or as soon thereafter as his successor was confirmed .
Subsequently , Souter &apos;s retirement was announced by President Barack Obama , at an unanticipated appearance at the daily White House press briefing on May 1 , 2009 . The same day , the Supreme Court released a letter from Justice Souter to the President , which indicated that Souter would be retiring when the court rose for its summer recess .
The letter did not state that Souter would stay on the court until his successor was confirmed , meaning that he would leave the Court by the end of June .
It did state that Souter intended &quot; to continue to render substantial judicial service as an Associate Justice &quot; — an apparent reference to the ability of a retired justice to serve by designation as a judge of a United States Court of Appeals or United States District Court .
Diego Rodríguez de Silva y Velázquez ( June 6 , 1599 – August 6 , 1660 ) was a Spanish painter who was the leading artist in the court of King Philip IV .
He was an individualistic artist of the contemporary baroque period , important as a portrait artist .
In addition to numerous renditions of scenes of historical and cultural significance , he painted scores of portraits of the Spanish royal family , other notable European figures , and commoners , culminating in the production of his masterpiece Las Meninas ( 1656 ) .
From the first quarter of the nineteenth century , Velázquez &apos;s artwork was a model for the realist and impressionist painters , in particular Édouard Manet .
Since that time , more modern artists , including Spain &apos;s Pablo Picasso and Salvador Dalí , as well as the Anglo ##AT##-##AT## Irish painter Francis Bacon , have paid tribute to Velázquez by recreating several of his most famous works .
After leaving Herrera &apos;s studio when he was 12 years old , Velázquez began to serve as an apprentice under Francisco Pacheco , an artist and teacher in Seville .
Though considered a generally dull , undistinguished painter , Pacheco sometimes expressed a simple , direct realism in contradiction to the style of Raphael that he was taught .
Velázquez remained in Pacheco &apos;s school for five years , studying proportion and perspective and witnessing the trends in the literary and artistic circles of Seville .
By the early 1620s , his position and reputation were assured in Seville .
In 1618 , Velázquez married Juana Pacheco ( June 1 , 1602 - August 10 , 1660 ) , the daughter of his teacher . She bore him two daughters — his only known family .
The younger , Ignacia de Silva Velázquez y Pacheco , died in infancy , while the elder , Francisca de Silva Velázquez y Pacheco ( 1619 ##AT##-##AT## 1658 ) , married painter Juan Bautista Martínez del Mazo at the Church of Santiago in Madrid on August 21 , 1633 .
Velázquez produced other notable works in this time .
Sacred subjects are depicted in Adoración de los Reyes ( 1619 , The Adoration of the Magi ) , and Jesús y los peregrinos de Emaús ( 1626 , Christ and the Pilgrims of Emmaus ) , both of which begin to express his more pointed and careful realism .
Velázquez went to Madrid in the first half of April 1622 , with letters of introduction to Don Juan de Fonseca , himself from Seville , who was chaplain to the King .
At the request of Pacheco , Velázquez painted the portrait of the famous poet Luis de Góngora y Argote .
Velázquez painted Góngora crowned with a laurel wreath , but painted over it at some unknown later date .
It is possible that Velázquez stopped in Toledo on his way from Seville , on the advice of Pacheco , or back from Madrid on that of Góngora , a great admirer of El Greco , having composed a poem on the occasion of his death .
In December 1622 , Rodrigo de Villandrando , the king &apos;s favorite court painter , died . Don Juan de Fonseca conveyed to Velázquez the command to come to the court from the Count ##AT##-##AT## Duke of Olivares , the powerful minister of Philip IV .
He was offered 50 ducats ( 175 g of gold — worth about € 2000 in 2005 ) to defray his expenses , and he was accompanied by his father ##AT##-##AT## in ##AT##-##AT## law . Fonseca lodged the young painter in his own home and sat for a portrait himself , which , when completed , was conveyed to the royal palace .
Olivares commanded Velázquez to move to Madrid , promising that no other painter would ever paint Philip &apos;s portrait and all other portraits of the king would be withdrawn from circulation . In the following year , 1624 , he received 300 ducats from the king to pay the cost of moving his family to Madrid , which became his home for the remainder of his life .
Through a bust portrait of the king , painted in 1623 , Velázquez secured admission to the royal service , with a salary of 20 ducats per month , besides medical attendance , lodgings and payment for the pictures he might paint . The portrait was exhibited on the steps of San Felipe and was received with enthusiasm .
1070 and 1071 ) in which the severity of the Seville period has disappeared and the tones are more delicate . The modeling is firm , recalling that of Antonio Mor , the Dutch portrait painter of Philip II , who exercised a considerable influence on the Spanish school .
Records indicate that he sat for Velázquez , but the picture is now lost . In September 1628 , Peter Paul Rubens came to Madrid as an emissary from the Infanta Isabella , and Velázquez kept his company among the Titians at the Escorial .
His picture was destroyed in a fire at the palace in 1734 . Recorded descriptions of it say that it depicted Philip III pointing with his baton to a crowd of men and women driven off under charge of soldiers , while the female personification of Spain sits in calm repose .
Velázquez was appointed gentleman usher as reward .
Later he also received a daily allowance of 12 réis , the same amount allotted to the court barbers , and 90 ducats a year for dress .
Five years after he painted it in 1629 , as an extra payment , he received 100 ducats for the picture of Bacchus ( The Feast of Bacchus ) .
The spirit and aim of this work are better understood from its Spanish name , Los Borrachos ( The Drunks ) or Los Bebedores ( the drinkers ) , who are paying mock homage to a half ##AT##-##AT## naked ivy ##AT##-##AT## crowned young man seated on a wine barrel .
The painting is firm and solid , and the light and shade are more deftly handled than in former works .
Altogether , this production may be taken as the most advanced example of the first style of Velázquez .
In 1629 , he went to live in Italy for a year and a half . Though his first Italian visit is recognized as a crucial chapter in the development of Velázquez &apos;s style - and in the history of Spanish Royal Patronage , since Philip IV sponsored his trip - we know rather little about the details and specifics : what the painter saw , whom he met , how he was perceived and what innovations he hoped to introduce into his painting .
It is canonical to divide the artistic career of Velázquez by his two visits to Italy , with his second grouping of works following the first visit and his third grouping following the second visit . This somewhat arbitrary division may be accepted though it will not always apply , because , as is usual in the case of many painters , his styles at times overlap each other .
Velázquez rarely signed his pictures , and the royal archives give the dates of only his most important works . Internal evidence and history pertaining to his portraits supply the rest to a certain extent .
His impassive , saturnine face is familiar to us from the many portraits painted by Velázquez .
Two are notable ; one is a full ##AT##-##AT## length , stately and dignified , in which he wears the green cross of the order of Alcantara and holds a wand , the badge of his office as master of the horse , the other , a great equestrian portrait in which he is flatteringly represented as a field marshal during action .
In these portraits , Velázquez has well repaid the debt of gratitude that he owed to his first patron , whom Velázquez stood by during Olivares &apos;s fall from power , thus exposing himself to the great risk of the anger of the jealous Philip . The king , however , showed no sign of malice towards his favorite painter .
The sculptor Juan Martínez Montañés modeled a statue of one of Velázquez &apos;s equestrian portraits of the king , painted in 1636 , which was cast in bronze by the Florentine sculptor Pietro Tacca and which now stands in the Plaza de Oriente at Madrid &#91; 2 &#93; .
The original of this portrait no longer exists , but several others do .
Velázquez , in this and in all his portraits of the king , depicts Philip wearing the golilla , a stiff linen collar projecting at right angles from the neck . It was invented by the king , who was so proud of it that he celebrated it by a festival followed by a procession to the church to thank God for the blessing .
Thus , the golilla was the height of fashion , and appeared in most of the male portraits of the period .
Velázquez was in constant and close attendance on Philip , accompanying him in his journeys to Aragon in 1642 and 1644 , and was doubtless present with him when he entered Lerida as a conqueror .
It was then that he painted a great equestrian portrait in which the king is represented as a great commander leading his troops — a role which Philip never played except in pageantry .
All is full of animation except the stolid face of the king .
It hangs as a pendant to the great Olivares portrait — fit rivals of the neighboring Charles V by Titian , which inspired Velázquez to excel himself , and both remarkable for their silvery tone and their feeling of open air .
One wonders who the beautiful woman can be who adorns the Wallace collection , a brunette so unlike the usual fair ##AT##-##AT## haired female sitters to Velázquez .
This picture is one of the ornaments of the Wallace collection . However , if few ladies of the court of Philip have been depicted , Velázquez painted several of his buffoons and dwarfs .
Velázquez appears to represent them with respect and sympathetically , as in El Primo ( 1644 , English : The Favorite ) , whose intelligent face and huge folio with ink ##AT##-##AT## bottle and pen by his side show him to be a wiser and better ##AT##-##AT## educated man than many of the gallants of the court .
Pablo de Valladolid ( 1635 , English : Paul of Valladolid ) , a buffoon evidently acting a part , and El Bobo de Coria ( 1639 , English : The Buffoon of Coria ) belong to this middle period .
The greatest of the religious paintings by Velázquez also belongs to this middle period , the Cristo Crucificado ( 1632 , English : Christ on the Cross ) .
It is a work of tremendous originality , depicting Christ immediately after death .
The Savior &apos;s head hangs on his breast and a mass of dark tangled hair conceals part of the face .
The picture was lengthened to suit its place in an oratory , but this addition has since been removed .
Some believe that the man in this painting is his uncle .
Philip now entrusted Velázquez with carrying out a design on which he had long set his heart : the founding of an academy of art in Spain . Rich in pictures , Spain was weak in statuary , and Velázquez was commissioned once again to proceed to Italy to make purchases .
Those works presage the advent of the painter &apos;s third and latest manner , a noble example of which is the great portrait of Pope Innocent X in the Doria Pamphilj Gallery in Rome , where Velázquez now proceeded .
There he was received with marked favor by the Pope , who presented him with a medal and golden chain .
Velázquez took a copy of the portrait — which Sir Joshua Reynolds thought was the finest picture in Rome — with him to Spain .
Several copies of it exist in different galleries , some of them possibly studies for the original or replicas painted for Philip . Velázquez , in this work , had now reached the manera abreviada , a term coined by contemporary Spaniards for this bolder , sharper style .
The portrait shows such ruthlessness in Innocent &apos;s expression that some in the Vatican feared that Velázquez would meet with the Pope &apos;s displeasure , but Innocent was well pleased with the work , hanging it in his official visitor &apos;s waiting room .
In 1650 in Rome Velázquez also painted a portrait of his servant , Juan de Pareja , now in the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York City .
This portrait procured his election into the Academy of St. Luke . Purportedly Velázquez created this portrait as a warm ##AT##-##AT## up of his skills before his portrait of the Pope .
It captures in great detail Pareja &apos;s countenance and his somewhat worn and patched clothing with an impressive economy of brushwork ; it is one of his best known pieces of portraiture .
One of the infantas , Margarita , the eldest daughter of the new Queen , appears to be subject of Las Meninas ( 1656 , English : The Maids of Honour ) , Velázquez &apos;s magnum opus .
However , in looking at the various viewpoints of the painting it is unclear as to who or what is the true subject .
Is it the royal daughter , or perhaps the painter himself ?
The answer may lie in the image on the back wall , depicting the King and Queen . Is this image a mirror , in which case the King and Queen are standing where we stand ?
Are they the subject of Velazquez &apos;s work ? Or is the work simply a court painting ?
Much is still in speculation about the true subject of this masterpiece , and many of the questions that we ask may never be truly answered .
Created four years before his death , it serves as an outstanding example of the European baroque period of art .
An apotheosis of the work has been effected since its creation ; Luca Giordano , a contemporary Italian painter , referred to it as the &quot; theology of painting , &quot; and the eighteenth century the Englishman Thomas Lawrence cited it as the &quot; philosophy of art , &quot; so decidedly capable of producing its desired effect .
That effect has been variously interpreted ; Dale Brown points out an interpretation that , in inserting within the work a faded portrait of the king and queen hanging on the back wall , Velázquez has ingeniously prognosticated the fall of the Spanish empire that was to gain momentum following his death .
Another interpretation is that the portrait is in fact a mirror , and that the painting itself is in the perspective of the King and Queen , hence their reflection can be seen in the mirror on the back wall .
It is said the king painted the honorary Cruz Roja ( Red Cross ) of the Orden de Santiago ( Order of Santiago ) on the breast of the painter as it appears today on the canvas .
However , Velázquez did not receive this honor of knighthood until three years after execution of this painting . Even the King of Spain could not make his favorite a belted knight without the consent of the commission established to inquire into the purity of his lineage .
The aim of these inquiries would be to prevent the appointment to positions of anyone found to have even a taint of heresy in their lineage — that is , a trace of Jewish or Moorish blood or contamination by trade or commerce in either side of the family for many generations . The records of this commission have been found among the archives of the Order of Santiago .
Velázquez was awarded the honor in 1659 .
His occupation as plebeian and tradesman was justified because , as painter to the king , he was evidently not involved in the practice of &quot; selling &quot; pictures .
There were essentially only two patrons of art in Spain — the church and the art ##AT##-##AT## loving king and court .
Bartolome Esteban Murillo was the artist favored by the church , while Velázquez was patronized by the crown . One difference , however , deserves to be noted .
Murillo , who toiled for a rich and powerful church , left little means to pay for his burial , while Velázquez lived and died in the enjoyment of good salaries and pensions .
One of his final works was Las hilanderas ( The Spinners ) , painted circa 1657 , representing either the interior of the royal tapestry works or a depiction of Ovid &apos;s Fable of Arachne , depending on interpretation .
It has recently been suggested that the tapestry in the background is based on Titian &apos; s The Rape of Europa , or , more probably , the copy that Rubens painted in Madrid .
&#91; 3 &#93; It is full of light , air and movement , featuring vibrant colors and careful handling .
Anton Raphael Mengs said this work seemed to have been painted not by the hand but by the pure force of will .
It displays a concentration of all the art ##AT##-##AT## knowledge Velázquez had gathered during his long artistic career of more than forty years . The scheme is simple — a confluence of varied and blended red , bluish ##AT##-##AT## green , grey and black .
Until the nineteenth century , little was known outside of Spain of Velázquez &apos;s work . His paintings mostly escaped being stolen by the French marshals during the Peninsular War .
In 1828 Sir David Wilkie wrote from Madrid that he felt himself in the presence of a new power in art as he looked at the works of Velázquez , and at the same time found a wonderful affinity between this artist and the British school of portrait painters , especially Henry Raeburn .
He was struck by the modern impression pervading Velázquez &apos;s work in both landscape and portraiture .
Presently , his technique and individuality have earned Velázquez a prominent position in the annals of European art , and he is often considered a father of the Spanish school of art . Although acquainted with all the Italian schools and a friend of the foremost painters of his day , he was strong enough to withstand external influences and work out for himself the development of his own nature and his own principles of art .
Velázquez is often cited as a key influence on the art of Édouard Manet , important when considering that Manet is often cited as the bridge between realism and Impressionism .
Calling Velázquez the &quot; painter of painters , &quot; Manet admired Velázquez &apos;s use of vivid brushwork in the midst of the baroque academic style of his contemporaries and built upon Velázquez &apos;s motifs in his own art .
The importance of Velázquez &apos;s art even today is evident in considering the respect with which twentieth century painters regard his work . Pablo Picasso presented the most durable homages to Velázquez in 1957 when he recreated Las Meninas in 58 variations , in his characteristically cubist form .
Although Picasso was concerned that his reinterpretations of Velázquez &apos;s painting would be seen merely as copies rather than unique representations , the enormous works — including the largest he had produced since Guernica in 1937 — earned a position of relevance in the Spanish canon of art . Picasso retained the general form and positioning of the original in the framework of his avant ##AT##-##AT## garde cubist style .
Salvador Dalí , as with Picasso in anticipation of the tercentennial of Velázquez &apos;s death , created in 1958 a work entitled Velázquez Painting the Infanta Margarita With the Lights and Shadows of His Own Glory .
The color scheme shows Dalí &apos;s serious tribute to Velázquez ; the work also functioned , as in Picasso &apos;s case , as a vehicle for the presentation of newer theories in art and thought — nuclear mysticism , in Dalí &apos;s case .
The Anglo ##AT##-##AT## Irish painter Francis Bacon found Velázquez &apos;s portrait of Pope Innocent X to be one of the greatest portraits ever made .
He created several expressionist variations of this piece in the 1950s ; however , Bacon &apos;s paintings presented a more gruesome image of the pope , who had now been dead for centuries .
One such famous variation , entitled Figure with Meat ( 1954 ) , shows the pope between two halves of a bisected cow .
Velazquez &apos; daughter was an ancestress of Marquises de Monteleon , including Enriquetta Casado who in 1746 married Heinrich VI , Count Reuss zu Köstritz and had a large number of descendants among German aristocracy , among them Prince Bernhard of the Netherlands , father of Queen Beatrix of the Netherlands &#91; 4 &#93; .
It is one of the seven uniformed services of the United States . As of 31 December 2008 , the U.S. Navy had about 331,682 personnel on active duty and 124,000 in the Navy Reserve .
It operates 283 ships in active service and more than 3,700 aircraft . &#91; 2 &#93; The U.S. Navy is the largest in the world ; its battle fleet tonnage is greater than that of the next 13 largest combined .
The mission of the United States Navy is to protect and defend the right of the United States and our allies to move freely on the oceans and to protect our country against her enemies .
The United States Navy serves as a seaborne branch of the Military of the United States . 10 U.S.C.
In the early stages of the American Revolutionary War , the establishment of an official navy was an issue of debate among the members of the Continental Congress .
While Congress deliberated , it received word that two unarmed British supply ships from England were heading towards Quebec without escort .
A plan was drawn up to intercept the ships — however , the armed vessels to be used were owned not by Congress , but by individual colonies .
Of greater significance , then , was an additional plan to equip two ships that would operate under the direct authority of Congress to capture British supply ships .
This was not carried out until 13 October 1775 , when George Washington announced that he had taken command of three armed schooners under Continental authority to intercept any British supply ships near Massachusetts .
The Continental Navy achieved mixed results ; it was successful in a number of engagements and raided many British merchant vessels , but it lost 24 of its vessels &#91; 11 &#93; and at one point was reduced to two in active service .
The United States would be without a navy for nearly a decade — a state of affairs that exposed its merchant ships to a series of attacks by Barbary pirates . The sole armed maritime presence between 1790 and the launching of the U.S. Navy &apos;s first warships in 1797 was the U.S. Revenue Cutter Service ( USRCS ) , the primary &quot; ancestor &quot; of the U.S. Coast Guard .
Following an undeclared Quasi ##AT##-##AT## War with France , the U.S. Navy saw substantial action in the War of 1812 , where it was victorious in numerous single ##AT##-##AT## ship duels with the Royal Navy . The Navy drove all significant British forces off the Great Lakes and Lake Champlain and prevented them from becoming British controlled zones of conflict .
The navy conducted the U.S. military &apos;s first large ##AT##-##AT## scale amphibious joint operation by successfully landing 12,000 army troops with their equipment in one day at Veracruz , Mexico . When larger guns were needed to bombard Veracruz Navy volunteers landed large navy guns and manned them in the successful bombardment of the city and its surrender .
This successful landing and capture of Veracruz eventually opening the way for the capture of Mexico City and the end of the war . &#91; 5 &#93; The United States Navy established itself as a player in American foreign policy through the actions of Commodore Matthew Perry in Japan , which resulted in the Convention of Kanagawa in 1854 .
The Navy saw little action during World War I , but grew into a formidable force in the years prior to World War II . Though ultimately unsuccessful , Japan attempted to allay this strategic threat with the 1941 surprise attack on Pearl Harbor .
Following American entry into the war , the U.S. Navy grew tremendously as the United States was faced with a two ##AT##-##AT## front war on the seas .
It achieved notable acclaim in the Pacific Theater , where it was instrumental to the Allies &apos; successful &quot; island hopping &quot; campaign .
&#91; 12 &#93; The U.S. Navy participated in many significant battles , including the Battle of the Coral Sea , the Battle of Midway , the Battle of the Philippine Sea , the Battle of Leyte Gulf , and the Battle of Okinawa .
By 1943 , the Navy &apos;s size was larger than the combined fleets of all the other combatant nations in World War II .
The Navy was a major participant in the Vietnam War , blockaded Cuba during the Cuban Missile Crisis , and , through the use of ballistic missile submarines , became an important aspect of the United States &apos; nuclear strategic deterrence policy .
The United States Navy conducted various combat operations in the Persian Gulf against Iran in 1987 and 1988 , most notably Operation Praying Mantis .
The Navy was extensively involved in Operation Urgent Fury , Operation Desert Shield , Operation Desert Storm , Operation Deliberate Force , Operation Allied Force , Operation Desert Fox and Operation Southern Watch .
The U.S. Navy has also been involved in Search and Rescue / Search and Salvage operations , some times in conjunction with vessels of other countries as well as with U.S. Coast Guard ships . Two examples are the 1966 Palomares B ##AT##-##AT## 52 crash incident and search for the nuclear bombs , and the Task Force 71 of the Seventh Fleet operation in search for Korean Air Lines Flight 007 shot down by the Soviets on Sept . 1 , 1983 .
The United States Navy continues to be a major support to American interests in the 21st century . Since the end of the Cold War , it has shifted its focus from preparations for large ##AT##-##AT## scale war with the Soviet Union to special operations and strike missions in regional conflicts .
&#91; 19 &#93; The Navy participated in Operation Enduring Freedom , Operation Iraqi Freedom , and is a major participant in the ongoing War on Terror , largely in this capacity .
Naval Special Warfare Command provides vision , leadership , doctrinal guidance , resources and oversight to ensure component maritime special operations forces are ready to meet the operational requirements of combatant commanders . The NSW has 5,400 total active ##AT##-##AT## duty personnel , including 2,450 SEALs and 600 Special Warfare Combatant ##AT##-##AT## craft Crewmen .
&#91; 25 &#93; Historically , the United States Navy has enjoyed a unique relationship with the United States Marine Corps ( USMC ) , partly because they both specialize in seaborne operations . At the very top level of civilian organization , the USMC is part of the Department of the Navy and reports to the Secretary of the Navy .
However , it is considered to be a distinct , separate service branch and not a subset of the Navy ; the highest ranking Marine officer , the Commandant of the Marine Corps , does not report to a Navy officer . Marine Corps Medal of Honor recipients are awarded the Navy variant and Marines are eligible to receive the Navy Cross .
The United States Naval Academy trains Marine Corps commissioned officers while Navy officers undergo instruction by Marine NCO Drill Instructors , in addition to their normal Recruit Division Commander . Naval Aviation includes Navy and Marine aviators , flight officers , and aircrew .
The largest overseas base is in Yokosuka , Japan , &#91; 41 &#93; which serves as the homeport for the Navy &apos;s largest forward ##AT##-##AT## deployed fleet and is a significant base of operations in the Western Pacific . European operations revolve around facilities in Italy and Greece with Naples as the homeport for the Sixth Fleet and CNRE Command Naval Region Europe .
In the Middle East , naval facilities are located almost exclusively in countries bordering the Persian Gulf , with Manama , Bahrain serving as the headquarters of U.S. Naval Forces Central Command and U.S. Fifth Fleet .
A carrier is typically deployed along with a host of additional vessels , forming a carrier battle group . The supporting ships , which usually include three or four Aegis -equipped cruisers and destroyers , a frigate , and two attack submarines , are tasked with protecting the carrier from air , missile , sea , and undersea threats as well as providing additional strike capabilities themselves .
Amphibious transport docks are warships that embark , transport , and land Marines , supplies , and equipment in a supporting role during amphibious warfare missions .
With a landing platform , amphibious transport docks also have the capability to serve as secondary aviation support for an expeditionary group .
All amphibious transport docks can operate helicopters , LCACs , and other conventional amphibious vehicles while the newer San Antonio class of ships has been explicitly designed to operate all three elements of the Marines &apos; &quot; mobility triad &quot; : Expeditionary Fighting Vehicles ( EFVs ) , the V ##AT##-##AT## 22 Osprey tiltrotor aircraft , and the previously mentioned LCACs .
Amphibious transport docks are named for cities , except for USS Mesa Verde ( LPD ##AT##-##AT## 19 ) , named for Mesa Verde National Park in Colorado , and two of the three ships named in memory of the September 11 , 2001 attacks : USS New York ( LPD ##AT##-##AT## 21 ) , for the state of New York , and USS Somerset ( LPD ##AT##-##AT## 25 ) for Somerset County , Pennsylvania .
The dock landing ship is a medium amphibious transport that is designed specifically to support and operate Landing Craft Air Cushions ( LCACs ) , though it is able to operate other amphibious assault vehicles in the United States inventory as well .
Dock landing ships are normally deployed as a component of an expeditionary strike group &apos;s amphibious assault contingent , operating as a secondary launch platform for LCACs . All dock landing ships are named after locations in the United States .
Modern U.S. frigates mainly perform anti ##AT##-##AT## submarine warfare for carrier strike groups and amphibious expeditionary groups and provide armed escort for supply convoys and merchant shipping .
They are designed to protect friendly ships against hostile submarines in low to medium threat environments , using torpedoes and LAMPS helicopters .
The U.S. Navy expects to retire and replace its current class of frigates by 2020 . &#91; 52 &#93; As in the case of destroyers , frigates are named after naval heroes .
All U.S. battleships have been decommissioned and all but two have been stricken from the Naval Vessel Register .
Designed to engage other capital ships in open sea warfare , battleships were the Navy &apos;s largest and most important vessels until the mid ##AT##-##AT## 20th century .
The rise of aircraft carriers in World War II led to the declining importance of battleships and the Navy relegated them to the roles of fire support and escort .
Following a long period of inactivity , the Iowa ##AT##-##AT## class battleships were recommissioned in the 1980s to augment the Navy &apos;s size and were upgraded with Tomahawk cruise missile capability .
They were decommissioned for the final time in the early 1990s due in part to their high maintenance costs and the Cold War &apos;s end . All battleships except USS Kearsarge ( BB ##AT##-##AT## 5 ) were named for states .
The primary missions of submarines in the U.S. Navy are peacetime engagement , surveillance and intelligence , special operations , precision strikes , battlegroup operations , and control of the seas . &#91; 53 &#93; The U.S. Navy operates two types : ballistic submarines and attack submarines .
Sea attack submarines are typically named for cities while land attack submarines ( Virginia- and converted Ohio ##AT##-##AT## class boats ) are typically named for states . Earlier attack submarines were named for &quot; denizens of the deep &quot; , while earlier ballistic missile submarines were named for &quot; famous Americans &quot; ( although many of them were actually foreigners ) .
The SEALs derive their name from the environments in and from which they can operate : SEa , Air , and Land .
Their distinguishing specialty , however , is maritime operations — striking from and returning to the sea . &#91; 58 &#93; The SEALs are a flexible group of naval Special Forces who are trained to conduct clandestine warfare , most often in small ##AT##-##AT## unit actions .
Navy special operations fall under the jurisdiction of Naval Special Warfare Command , the Navy branch of United States Special Operations Command .
Although not under the jurisdiction of NSW Command , Navy Explosive Ordnance Disposal Units often work closely with special operations teams .
Trained to be combat ##AT##-##AT## ready and highly mobile , EOD units are entrusted with nullifying hazardous ordnance in a number of different maritime environments .
NECC consolidates , aligns and integrates diverse expeditionary capabilities and combat support elements to create consistent expeditionary practices , procedures , requirements and logistics in the battle space .
NECC ’ s enterprise approach will yield improved efficiencies and effectiveness through economies of scale and common processes .
The Maritime Expeditionary Security Force ’ s ( MESF ) ( formerly known as Naval Coastal Warfare ) primary mission is force protection conducted through fleet support with operations around the world . Anti ##AT##-##AT## Terrorism and Force Protection missions include harbor and homeland defense , coastal surveillance , and special missions .
MESF units deploy worldwide to detect , deter , and defend an area , unit , or High Value Asset . Recent locations include the United States , Korea , Saudi Arabia , Kuwait , Bahrain , United Arab Emirates , and Egypt .
Coastal and harbor defense and protection of naval assets are placed under the jurisdiction of two Naval Coastal Warfare Groups : one for the Pacific Fleet and one for the Atlantic Fleet . Within these groups are Mobile Security Squadrons and Naval Coastal Warfare Squadrons .
MSSs deploy Mobile Security Detachments that provide force protection for high value naval targets in ports and harbors where U.S. shore infrastructure is limited or does not exist . Naval Coastal Warfare Squadrons provide surveillance and security in harbors , coasts , and inshore areas .
MIUWUs are charged with security , observation , and communications support for commanders operating in an inshore / coast environment , including anchorages and harbors . In the same operating environment , IBUs manage water craft for security , interdiction and surveillance .
The current naval jack of the United States is the First Navy Jack , traditionally regarded as having been used during the American Revolutionary War . On 31 May 2002 , Secretary of the Navy Gordon England directed all U.S. naval ships to fly the First Navy Jack for the duration of the War on Terrorism .
Many ships chose to shift colors later that year on the first anniversary of the September 11 , 2001 attacks . The previous naval jack was a blue field with 50 white stars , identical to the canton of the ensign ( the flag of the United States ) both in appearance and size , and continues to remain in use with vessels of the U.S. Coast Guard .
A jack of similar design was used in 1794 , though with 13 stars arranged in a 3 – 2 – 3 – 2 – 3 pattern . When a ship is moored or anchored , the jack is flown from the bow of the ship while the ensign is flown from the stern .
Over the course of the Navy &apos;s 207 ##AT##-##AT## year existence , a distinct jargon has evolved among American sailors and has become a normal part of their everyday speech .
Modern U.S. Navy slang draws from a number of varied sources .

No discussion of prices is needed with the bus , as they used fixed rates .
To give you an idea of prices , buses running from Cotonou to Natitingou ( or vice versa ) costs 7.500f CFA one way , and Cotonou to Parakou ( or vice versa ) costs 5.500f CFA .
These are examples , because there are also buses that go as far as Tanguieta and Malanville .
Traffic is chaotic and the rules of the road are rarely enforced .
If you are planning on driving yourself in Benin , an International Driver &apos;s license is required .
Traffic flows on the same side of the road as the US and Canada .
Hiring a local guide is recommended .
Police roadblocks at night occur regularly and traveling alone with a driver ( especially if you are a woman ) may put the driver in an awkward position explaining and / or bribing the police .
There are many pirogues ( kayak / canoe ) used for the fishing industry . Normally one can use a pirogue to visit the lake villages .
The best way to stay safe in Benin is to always always always be in the presence of a local person whom you can trust , such as a friend or even a hired tourist guide . They know which areas are safe and which are not , they know the prices of things so you won &apos;t get ripped off , they speak the native languages , they know which venues sell good food that is safe for westerners to eat .
Benin is a peaceful country and the people are very kind and generous , but that being said muggings and robberies occur everywhere no matter how peaceful the place so be on guard . If you are a victim of a crime , contact the Gendarme ( Police ) immediately .
Along with vaccines against polio , hepatitis A and B , Measles , Mumps , Rubella , Lock Jaw , Rabies and all the other standard childhood vaccines ( as per Canadian public school standards ) . AIDS is an issue in Benin as in all sub ##AT##-##AT## Saharan African countries ; use of a condom is highly recommended if entering into a sexual relationship with a Beninese partner .

One of Bermuda &apos;s few taxes is its steep import duty . This varies depending on the item and the importer .
If the cost of the vehicle before it is landed is less than BD $ 10,000 , the duty is 80 % . For cars costing $ 10,000 or greater , before landing , the duty is 100 % .
The dealer must add his own profit margin on top of this . Each person arriving on the island is allowed a $ 100 exemption , but if a visitor is deemed to be carrying more than that amount he / she will be subject to the duty on the excess value .

Bordeaux is a flat city , built on the banks of the Garonne River . It is also the largest French city in area and geographically one of the largest in Europe .
The Garonne merges a dozen kilometers below the city with another river , the Dordogne River to form the Gironde Estuary , which is biggest estuary in France .
There are no skyscrapers in Bordeaux , just a few tall buildings due to the weakness of the subsoil , which explains its sprawl . The center of the town has retained its traditional stone mansions and smart terraces , hence the reason behind the city being called &quot; Little Paris &quot; .
The main train station ( Gare Saint Jean ) is located about 4km from the center of town .
Several trains per day ( around one every two hours ) go north ( to Paris , about 3 hours 30 , Angoulème , Poitiers ) , south ( to Toulouse , Marseille , Montpellier ( about 4 to 5 hours ) , up to Nice ) , and east ( to Périgueux and Clermont ##AT##-##AT## Ferrand ) .
If you &apos;re travelling with bikes European Bike Express &#91; 3 &#93; run a route from north of Leeds , stopping through the UK to Dover and then on towards Bayonne via Bordeaux .
Passengers normally travel from the UK to Europe .
Bordeaux is quite a big city , however most of the interesting attractions are in the town center .
The most interesting way to explore the city is by walking . As most of the town center is a &apos; pedestrian area &apos; , this is easy to do .
Three efficient tramway lines are also available ( A , B and C ) , tickets cost 1 , 40 Euros and covers unlimited journeys within one hour of validation .
It is possible to rent roller ##AT##-##AT## skates at a small sport ##AT##-##AT## shop called &quot; Pierre Qui Roule &quot; , situated on the western side of Place Gambetta , north of the pedestrian area .
Tickets can be purchased on the bus , however that &apos;s expensive and you cannot change buses with the tickets bought on the bus . The best thing is to buy tickets either at the TBC agencies ( Gare Saint ##AT##-##AT## Jean , Gambetta , Quinconces ) , at almost any tobacconist , or at the tourist offices ( Quinconces , Gare Saint ##AT##-##AT## Jean ) .
You have also the possibility to buy tickets that will enable you to access freely the bus network for one to six days - those tickets cost from 3.75 up to 11.80 euros . Students and elderly persons can buy tickets at a reduced price .
Avoid the buses on peak hours ( 8 ##AT##-##AT## 10AM , 4 ##AT##-##AT## 7PM ) , as the town center is usually totally jammed ( and cars often block bus tracks ) , and buses are overcrowded .
It is managed by the CGFTE , and thus you can get in the boat using a standard bus ticket . The bus goes from the Southern part of Quai Richelieu , and to the Place Aristide Briand , very close to the Aquitaine Bridge ( one of the must ##AT##-##AT## see in Bordeaux ) .
A new tramway &#91; 4 &#93; serves the town , crossing the Garonne via the Pont de Pierre . A distinctive feature of the tramway is that within the inner city , it has no overhead wires , although this may change due to recent issues with the ground ##AT##-##AT## level power supply system .
The electric bus , called la navette du centre ##AT##-##AT## ville , is the only public transportation on pedestrian roads . There are no bus stops for this one : to board an electric bus , wave your hand to the driver - he will stop the bus and let you on .
Bordeaux gardens open : end March to end October - 8AM to 8PM ; end October to end March - 8AM to 6PM . Bordeaux gardens admission is free .
Bordeaux is a great city for learning- to learn a bit about French culture , consider visiting cinemas such as Utopia &#91; 9 &#93; or going to the city library in Meriadeck .
Bordeaux has made its wealth out of trade , and the local economic system relies heavily on shops and trading halls . The Pedestrian Center is basically full of stores of all kinds , from clothes to art , craftworks , food and wine etc .
Bordeaux is covered by the three major telecommunication operators in France : France Telecom ( Orange ) , Bouygues , and SFR .
If you have a GSM cellphone with an international subscription , you should be able to give calls from anywhere in the city . It is also possible to find phone cabins , but some have been removed recently due to their decreased usage .
Bordeaux is not a city known for insecurity , and if you respect some simple rules , you shouldn &apos;t have any problems .
There are a lot of interesting things to see close to Bordeaux .

Brandenburg ( German : Brandenburg ) , ( Lower Sorbian : Bramborska ; Upper Sorbian : Braniborska ) &#91; 1 &#93; is a historical region and a modern federal state in Germany . Brandenburg was historically composed of a larger amount of territory now located across the Oder River in western Poland .
Brandenburg is known for its nature .
There is one national park , the Lower Oder Valley National Park .
Besides , there are three UNESCO Biosphere Reserves , Flusslandschaft Elbe , Schorfheide ##AT##-##AT## Chorin , and Spreewald .
Within less than an hour , you can get out of the city and find yourself in the middle of a forest or a pretty village , at the banks of a lovely lake or in front of a medieval church or castle . The major attraction of Brandenburg is the city of Potsdam with its UNESCO world heritage .
However , besides Potsdam , there are plenty of less spectacular attractions that make Brandenburg worth a trip . The grey remainders of 40 years of communist ruling are gone , and now Brandenburg offers lots to discover .
Younger people normally do understand English , the older tend to speak Russian rather than English . Sorbian is spoken in a small region in the south bordering Saxony .
Since Berlin is located in the middle of Brandenburg , there are highways ( Autobahn ) to all major directions crossing through Brandenburg . Many places in Brandenburg can be reached by car within one or two hours from the center of Berlin .
The Berlin ##AT##-##AT## Brandenburg ##AT##-##AT## Public ##AT##-##AT## Traffic ##AT##-##AT## Network ( vbb ) co ##AT##-##AT## ordinates public transport in the region . There is also a consistent tariff system , so travelers can by a ticket for the entire journey even if they change from the train to buses .
The easiest way to get around is by car .
There are several highways ( Autobahn ) , that connect Berlin with different German regions - all leading through Brandenburg .
In addition , there are well maintained roads .
Public transport to many rural destinations is poor . There are a few railroad connections within Brandenburg and there are public buses , but travelers should check timetables for connections .

Today , Dijon is a cosmopolitan city , with universities in the center and industrial plants on the outskirts . Traffic is restricted in the center of the city , so many parts of central Dijon are quiet and relaxing .

From the airport , taxis are available but not inexpensive ( about 200kn ) .
Reliable bus service to the Old City is available through Atlas , and meet all scheduled flights , with the drop off location in the Old City at Pile Gate or the bus station in Gruž .
While there are a great many pensions and the tourist office at the Pile Gate location , most hotels ( with the exception of the Hilton ) are not located there .
Pile Gate does happen to be major city bus stop though , with buses quickly taking people to nearly any location in the city including the main swath of hotels on Babin Kuk .
Tickets can be bought on the bus or more cheaply from the news stands at Pile .
Vendors will understand &apos; bus ticket &apos; ( or &apos; autobusne karte &apos; in Croatian ) as they see a great many tourists through this location .
There is no train to Dubrovnik , although you can take a train to Split and then travel by bus to Dubrovnik .
The bus station in Split is located right next to the train station on the wharf .
Just know that in the summer months the trip is likely to take several hours longer than anticipated .
The new bus station is located in Kantafig , northern part of the city , a distance from the old city ( near the northern approach and the Tudjman bridge ) , with domestic and international departures , as well as services heading to the airport ( check times with Croatia Airlines ) . To get there , use the local bus service ( operating around every 15 minutes , e.g.
Other international services operate to cities such as Trieste in Italy , and there are daily services to Mostar and Sarajevo in Bosnia and Herceg Novi and Kotor in Montenegro .
When traveling into Montenegro and the Airport sit on the right hand side ( not behind driver ) for best views , and vice ##AT##-##AT## versa for the return . Traveling to Bosnia , sit on the left hand side ( behind the driver ) for best views .
This fee of 2 € per piece of luggage is paid to the driver upon boarding . Some drivers are rather picky about being paid in exact change in the correct currency ( sometimes a local currency , at other instances requesting to be paid in euros ) and sometimes also refuse to be paid in small coins .
The old town is completely pedestrianised and easily small enough to get around on foot - some of the streets are a little steep though !
If you are not staying in the Old Town , it &apos;s relatively simple get there by bus , as just about every one leads to the Old Town .
It costs 8kn ( just over 1 euro ) for tickets bought at any kiosk , or 10kn bought on the bus ; ticket valid for 1hr . At selected kiosks ( including the international bus station ) you can purchase a day pass for 25hr .
This pass is valid for 24 hours of unlimited travel on the city bus network , starting from the first validation .
The easiest way to get from the Main Bus Station to the Old Town is by using the ( mostly modern and air ##AT##-##AT## conditioned ) buses number 1 , 1A and 1B , which circulate almost constantly .
Dubrovnik was heavily bombed by the Montenegrin Navy during the Croatian War of Independence from 1991 to 1995 .
Almost all of the damage has been covered over but if you look closely around the old town you can still see the damage from mortars in the cobblestone streets and bullet marks in the stone houses .
Dubrovnik has a number of educational institutions .
There are many local artisans who specialize in domestic crafts .
Many merchants claim that the necktie was invented in Croatia .
Another local specialty is little dolls dressed in local garb .
The pharmacy at the Franciscan Monastery creates hand creams and other toiletries based on ancient recipes .
There is a wide range of restaurants in the Old Town , mostly offering a very similar menu of local seafood and some meat dishes . The cuisine may not be very imaginative , but it is usually of good quality and very fresh .
There are a few pizzerias , mostly wood ##AT##-##AT## fired and quite acceptable . The Kraš chocolate sold at stores is delicious .
Remember that Dubrovnik , more so than the rest of Croatia , is well aware of its status as a tourist hot ##AT##-##AT## spot , and prices reflect that knowledge . Finding true value in the Old Town of Dubrovnik is very difficult , and finding a meal outside of it can be nearly impossible .
The most popular hard alcohol in Croatia is home made rakija .
This is a very strong distilled drink made from a variety of fruits .
Examples include sljivovica ( made from plums ) , loza ( made from grapes ) , and orahovica ( made with walnuts ) .
All are quite strong and , like most hard liquors , have an unappealing taste to some people while others find them quite enjoyable .
There are many excellent local wines from both the Peljesac Peninsula and Konavle and it is often less expensive than soft drinks like Coca Cola .
However , be careful when purchasing wine from unlicensed dealers ( though the price is very attractive with some being as low as 10kn or 1.5 euro per liter ) as it can sometimes be of low quality .
There are numerous cafes throughout the Old Town and the entire city with prices varying according to the location ( particularly , those located on the Stradun are by far the most expensive but you are paying for the ambiance as well ) .
Villa Micika is One of Dubrovniks best choices for budget accommodation . Funky , clean , character rooms , dorms , big shared terrace FREE Internet and wireless internet .
Nearby are restaurants , bars , pubs , tennis courts , shopping center and promenade . All rooms have television ( local and international channels ) , air conditioned , and bathrooms with shower cabin and WC .

From Amsterdam , Leeuwarden can be reached by two different routes : the western route via the A7 and the A31 and the eastern one via the A1 , A6 and A32 .
A direct intercity service connects Leeuwarden to both Amsterdam and Schiphol Airport .
The journey will take about two and a half hours .

Marseille is perhaps not the kind of city you will fall in love with your first day there . It is not Paris ; there are few obvious &quot; things to do &quot; along the lines of the Louvre museum or the Champs ##AT##-##AT## Elysees .
Marseilles ##AT##-##AT## Provence International Airport &#91; 2 &#93; ( IATA : MRS ) is located about thirty kilometers from Marseilles .
Buses , taxis and now train connect in less than 30 minutes .
( Shuttles every European cities in Marseilles has made more places available from Marseille .
The main train station is Marseille St. Charles .
Marseille has TGV lines to Paris ( 3 hours ) , Nice ( 2 hours ) and to Brussels ( 5 hours ) .
From Barcelona , there is a connection to Cerbère , from which there are regular trains to Marseille ; also a night train .
From Marseille there are at least direct connections to Barcelona , Prague and Tangier . The bus station is next to the main train station , the St. Charles Station at Rue Honnorat .
There is also an Eurolines office on the 3 Allée Léon Gambetta ; If you walk down the big stairs on the southside of the station , follow the road until you come to a squarelike intersection .
The office is on your right hand .
Marseille is very well connected to most French cities through numerous highways .
As always in France those highways are expensive but practical , comfortable and fast .
Marseille is around 8 hours from Paris by car , 2 hours from Nice , 1h30 from Montpellier , 4 hours from Toulouse and 3 hours from Lyon .
Marseille has a big harbour . There are direct ferry routes from Marseille to Ajaccio , Bastia , Porto Torres , Porto Vecchio and Propriano .
There are several piers at the harbour , so it is advisable to check well in advance from which pier you are departing .
The Control of Marseilles Transport RTM &#91; 5 &#93; which manages the network of public transport does not have good reputation among the Marseillais , there exists a solid network of lines of bus ( 74 lines ) and subway ( 2 lines ) . However the bus management is far from being optimal , and you will not be surprised to see early or late buses !
Airport Transfers are available for 8.50 € each way to / from Gare St Charles . Tickets may be bought at an outdoor structure between Hall 1 and Hall 3 / 4 of the main terminal , and at an outdoor structure behind Gare St Charles near bus quai # 26 at the rear of the station .
The bus runs every 20 minutes on 10 , 30 , and 50 minutes past the hour . The ride is about 30 minutes .
The bus says Navette Aeroport Gare St Charles on it . From Gare St Charles , the metro can get you to most hotels .
Metro tickets allow unlimited transfers within 1 hour of initial use for the base 1.70 € fare including re ##AT##-##AT## entry ( 1hour limit ) to the subway .
A Ferry Boat allows to cross the Old Harbour ( Vieux Port ) .
Avoid taking your car if you can . Marseille , at least the center , has narrow streets , one ##AT##-##AT## way streets and so on which will make non locals crazy .
In addition , the local drivers have a reputation for fearlessness .
Due to the new tramway , satellite navigational systems such as the Tom Tom are likely to be out of date and dangerous if followed .
For instance , following a Tom Tom in the centre of Marseille could take you across newly installed pedestrian areas or Tram lines . The one ##AT##-##AT## way system has also completely changed .
le Vieux Port ( old harbour ) : watching fishermen selling their stock by auction is a must . Arriving to Marseille in the Vieux ##AT##-##AT## Port on a summer evening is something you will never forget ... You can watch this show by going to Frioul islands or Chateau d &apos;If and going back late in the afternoon .
Notre Dame de la Garde : the big church which overlooks the city .
Old fishermen used to have their boats blessed in this church . You can still see many boat models hanging around in the church .
From there it is one of the nicest view of the city .
Musée des Docks romains ( Archéologie ##AT##-##AT## Graffiti ##AT##-##AT## Lapidaire ) ( the old harbour from Phoenician and Roman times ) , Place Vivaux , 13002 Marseille .
Musée d &apos;Archéologie méditerranéenne ( Archéologie ##AT##-##AT## Graffiti ##AT##-##AT## Lapidaire ) , Centre de la Vieille Charité , 2 Rue de la Charité , 13002 Marseille .
le Cours Julien and la plaine : a hangout area with bookstores , cafés , fountains , and a playground for the small ones ( metro stop Cours Julien / Notre Dame du Mont ) .
It is THE trendy area of Marseille .
La Plaine is the local name for Place Jean Jaurès close to Cours Julien .
Every Thursday and Saturday morning the Plaine market is the place to shop . If you are there early enough you can make very good deals , even if what you &apos;ll find there is sometimes &quot; tombé du camion &quot; ( fallen off the truck ) as one says in Marseille .
Le Panier . Panier means basket in French , but in Marseille it is the name of the oldest area of the town .
In the middle of this area there is the Vielle Charité , a wonderful old monument , now hosting museums and exhibitions .
Unité d &apos;Habitation : designed by Le Corbusier . The building is called &quot; la maison du fada &quot; ( the house of the foolish ) by indegenous people .
Noailles : The area around the Noailles sub ##AT##-##AT## way station is one of the citys most interesting .
Lined with Arabic and Indo ##AT##-##AT## Chinese shops some of the streets could be part of a bazzaar in Algeria . A fascinating area .
The Château d &apos;If ( If Castle ) : this small island off the city was a penal colony .
It is famous from the novel of Alexandre Dumas , the Comte de Monte ##AT##-##AT## Cristo .
Tourist boats leave from the Old harbour .
Marseille is an important university center .
The campus at Luminy , on the edge of the callanques is set in spectacular scenery from where the road heads along the coast to Casis .
La bouillabaisse is an excellent fish ##AT##-##AT## based soup served with la rouille ( a garlic ##AT##-##AT## saffron sauce ) and bread similar to crostini .
La bouillabaisse cannot be enjoyed at any budgetary level .
If you are invited to the home of someone making bouillabaisse , then you are in the clear .
Never eat cheap bouillabaisse at a resto unless it &apos;s not called bouillabaisse ; only eat it out if you have to reserve in advance .
Bouillabaisse is a meal ... first the soup , then the fish .
Four des Navettes : next to the St Victor Fort , this bakery is famous for its &quot; Navette &quot; dry biscuit which recipe has been kept secret for almost a century .
This is one of Marseille &apos;s culinary speciality .. not to miss .
le Petit Nice : on La Plaine next to the Court Julien , nice little cafe .

Port Elizabeth &#91; 1 &#93; ( or just PE if you want to sound South African ) is South Africa &apos; s fifth largest city and is located on the Indian Ocean coast half ##AT##-##AT## way between Cape Town and Durban , in the Eastern Cape , about 260 km from Knysna .
Also known as the friendly city and the windy city , it tends to live up to both names .
Brooke &apos;s Pavilion has excellent views over the beaches and ocean .
Any one of the restaurants there are a good idea for breakfast with a view .

From Koh Kong / Hat Lek ( border crossing with Thailand ) : The road between Koh Kong and Sihanoukville now is paved and generally in good condition , with ferries replaced by bridges , and the trip takes about 5 hours . &quot; Local &quot; and &quot; Tourist &quot; minibuses service this route ; they are always jam ##AT##-##AT## packed , and the trip can be uncomfortable .
They will also typically have pickup in front of the offices on the main strip in town at 7 : 30a ( at which point they simply drive over to the station to wait until the 8 : 30 departure time . ) You may be offered pickup at your hotel if you book there ( usually at a slightly inflated price over what you can get directly at the ticket office .
A chartered taxi from Phnom Penh &apos; s Central Market can do the trip in less than three hours and will cost anywhere from US $ 25 ##AT##-##AT## 40 , depending on the petrol price of the day and how beat up the vehicle is .
You can reduce the price by sharing seats , but be warned that Khmers will squeeze as many as eight people into the car , including two in the drivers seat , so most people will need to buy two seats for comfort .
Boats used to run daily from Koh Kong / Hat Lek ( the border crossing with Thailand ) , taking around 4 hours and costing US $ 20 / 700 baht .
However , the service was suspended in 2008 and it &apos;s unclear if it will resume , since travel by road is now cheaper , safer and just as fast .
There are no longer any passenger services on the Phnom Penh to Sihanoukville railway line .
It may be possible to hitch a ride with the freight train security guards - enquire locally for further information .
Distances between the beaches are a little too long to walk comfortably , but getting around is easy , as the roads are wide and bike taxis ( motodop ) are everywhere .
They &apos;ll gladly pile on two people and their luggage too . For larger groups , car taxis can be called up by phone ( flat US $ 5 to most places around town ) and there are dozens of the ubiquitous tuk ##AT##-##AT## tuks around the new bus station and the accommodation areas .
They are some of the most persistent and over ##AT##-##AT## charging drivers in Cambodia .
Another great choice to get around fast and free is to rent a scooter . Haggle a bit and you can get it for US $ 5 a day , fuel is quite cheap and can be bought at many roadside shacks .
The reason to visit Sihanoukville is the beaches .
Not as crowded as some of the Thai resorts , but they can be cramped on weekends and holidays .
Also visitors should be aware that , like many Southeast Asian beaches , these ones are covered in a lot more rubbish than Western beach ##AT##-##AT## goers are used to .
For diving go to one of the nearby islands .
The town itself doesn &apos;t offer much to see .
Sokha Beach - all but 100 meters of it reserved for guests of the Sokha Beach Resort .
Ochheuteal Beach - the most popular beach , with many restaurants , bars and food vendors .
This pure unspoilt tropical island experience is a wonderful place to relax . Prices on the island tend to be about 50 % above the average Sihanoukville level and their are no banks or Atm &apos;s so make sure you take enough money .
Koh Ru Resort ( Bamboo Island ) This recently refurbished bungalow resort is quite basic with $ 10 having a shared bathroom but excellent location right on the sand .
The owners are in the process of building a dormitory priced at $ 3 a bed to make the island more accessible to budget travelers .
You can book $ 10 return boat transfers from the Koh Ru booking office two doors away from the Boom Boom Room shop on Serendipity Beach Road .
Snorkeling - is possible around most of the islands , with the best snorkeling being at the further our islands for visibility , corals and fish .
Many restaurants at Serendipity Beach advertise a snorkeling trip for 15 $ , but most are incapable of properly explaining what their offer includes .
Most will boil down to the same trip organized by one of the travel agents which includes ( simple ) breakfast at the beach , a visit to two snorkeling spots and a 3 hour lunchbreak at Bamboo Island .
Ream National Park - a wonderful mangrove nature reserve about 30 minutes driving from Sihanoukville .
Probably the best way is to contact the park rangers by phone and see if they can arrange a guide to show you around in a boat ##AT##-##AT## hiking combi .
There are several small shops in the town , plus a standard Cambodian market ( &apos; Psaa Leu &apos; ) . Handicrafts organization Rajana has a branch above the Starfish Cafe .
Although tourism is growing , don &apos;t go expecting large scale tourist markets like Siam Reap , Phnom Penh , Bangkok , Phuket . As at November 2008 , there is still no tailor .
ATM machines can now be found throughout Snooky .
Downtown , ANZ Bank has two and Canadia Bank has one and Acleda Bank has one .
There &apos;s also one at CCS Hotel and one at the Golden Sands Hotel , Occheuteal Beach .
Along the beaches there are many food stalls and some restaurants , especially at Ochheuteal beach .
There are a good many restaurants in town as well . Sihanoukville has a surprisingly diverse set of cuisines .
Angelo &apos;s Restaurant , Near Golden Sands Hotel , Excellent BBQ ( try the ribs ! ! !
Japanese restaurant with sashimi ( raw fish ) and awesome ribs .
French ##AT##-##AT## Khmer cuisine in one of the finest restaurants in the country . Entrees US $ 5 ##AT##-##AT## 11 .

The staff are extremely well trained &amp; friendly , and prices are not overly expensive , with Pasta &apos;s and Pizza &apos;s at around 8 to 9 dollars .
Monkey Republic , Near Serendipity Beach . 75c happy hour Draft , Big parties every Thursday .
Star Bar , Located downtown behind Shell gas station . Extremely cold Anchor draft beer ( happy hour 50c , rest of the day 75c ) .
25c happy hour draft , $ 1 Vodka Mixers , outside dance floor .
Accommodation ranges from basic guest houses on the beach to four ##AT##-##AT## star resorts .
There &apos;s no shortage of guesthouses and pre ##AT##-##AT## booking is only necessary at peak times such as at New Year .
Good value rooms starting at $ 5 for fan and cold water with cable TV . $ 6 gets you hot water and 10 + there are air ##AT##-##AT## con options also .

Same Same But Different , next to Malibu Hotel .
Downtown , behind Caltex . Clean and comfortable A / C rooms US $ 6 ##AT##-##AT## 15 .
Savannphoum , 300 meters from Serendipity Beach . A nice alternative for people wanting to stay close to rather than on the beach ; most of the guests are Khmer .

Vanuatu &#91; 1 &#93; ( previously known as the New Hebrides Islands ) is an archipelago nation consisting of 83 islands in the southwest Pacific Ocean , north of New Zealand and east of Australia .
The islands of Vanuatu are grouped into six geographic provinces , the names formed by combining the first syllables or letters of the major islands in each .
The British and French who settled the New Hebrides in the 19th century agreed in 1906 to an Anglo ##AT##-##AT## French Condominium , which administered the islands until independence in 1980 .
European settlers released several saltwater crocodiles on the island , although today &apos;s population on the island officially stands at 2 or 3 medium ##AT##-##AT## sized individuals on the Banks Islands and no breeding has been observed .
Despite its proximity to Papua New Guinea , crocodiles do not naturally occur on Vanuatu .
The climate is tropical , and almost always warm , with temperatures in the 20s and 30s celsius .
A long list of countries are exempted from visas &#91; 2 &#93; , which includes all Commonwealth and European Economic Community Member countries .
All visitors must have a passport valid for a further 4 months and an onward ticket .
On arrival , you will be allowed an initial stay of up to 30 days , extended one month at a time for up to 4 months .
Kava is a local drink , made from the roots of the plant Piper methysticum , a type of pepper . Kava is intoxicating , but not like alcohol .
Its effects are sedative . Some travellers have experienced a hangover from its consumption .
There is a choice of all levels of accommodation .
When visiting other islands or villages outside of the cities , there are many small guest houses that charge around 2000 VT per night and offer full service ( meals , laundry , etc ) .

Air Southwest &#91; 3 &#93; operate domestics to Manchester and Newquay .
bmibaby &#91; 4 &#93; operates domestic services to Edinburgh , Glasgow , Jersey and Belfast , and international services to Alicante , Amsterdam , Faro , Ibiza , Malaga , Murcia , Palma de Mallorca and Prague .
KLM &#91; 5 &#93; operates services to Amsterdam 4 to 5 times a day .
The island of Anglesey is along the A55 road along the North Wales coast .
If you are approaching from the south try the A5 which is a scenic route that takes you through the mountains of North Wales .
The North Wales Coast Line links Manchester , Crewe and London ( in England ) with the northern seaside resorts of Rhyl and Prestatyn , the city of Bangor , the isle of Anglesey and the port of Holyhead .
Through tickets to Dublin ( Ireland ) are available , which include the ferry from Holyhead to Dun Laoghaire .
The Conwy Valley Line stretches from Llandudno Junction along the Conwy Valley via Betws y Coed to Blaenau Ffestiniog , and connects with trains on both the North Wales Coast line and the Ffestiniog Railway .
The beautiful Cambrian Coast Line runs from Shrewsbury ( in England ) , across Mid ##AT##-##AT## Wales through Machynlleth , and through the coastal towns of Tywyn and Barmouth , through the south part of Snowdonia , Harlech and Porthmadog , and along the south coast of the Lleyn Peninsula to Pwllheli .
Regular ferry services operate between Holyhead in North Wales and Ireland , ( Dublin and Dun Laoghaire ) , and is provided by two carriers . Stenaline &#91; 21 &#93; and Irish Ferries &#91; 22 &#93; both offer multiple daily service between the two ports for passengers and vehicles .
Due to Wales &apos; topography and historic development , most travelling in Wales is done along an East ##AT##-##AT## West axis rather than a North ##AT##-##AT## South Axis . Rail and road links between centres in South Wales , and along the North Wales coast are by and large quick and efficient , especially along the M4 and A55 .
An important exception to this is M4 J32 ( the interchange with the A470 ) during peak morning rush hour , which gets congested with Cardiff Commuter traffic . The roundabout at junction 32 is the largest in Europe .
Travelling between the Cardiff and the other main population centres , Swansea and Newport is very straightforward .
Wales is a small country and flying is not a common mode of internal transport .
There is in fact only one domestic route , Cardiff International Airport to Anglesey Airport .
This is probably the quickest way by far to travel between North and South Wales .
This route is served by two services each way per day .
The journey costs approximately £ 50 each way , takes about an hour .
Although of course time taken getting to and from the airport needs to be factored into the travelling time for such relatively short air journey .
Driving between North and South Wales takes approximately 5 to 6 hours , although the journey takes in some spectacular scenery , especially for journeys on the more Western route through Snowdonia via Corris , Dolgellau , Blaenau Ffestiniog , the Crimea Pass and the Conwy Valley . The two main North South roads are the A470 Cardiff to Llandudno and the A483 Swansea to Chester .
Basically there are three separate Welsh limbs which are part of the British system- although there have been moves in recent years to improve intra Wales railway services . The limbs are basically a North Wales line to Holyhead , a line to Aberystwyth in the Centre , and a main line in South Wales , forming an extension of the London Paddington to West of England main line .
Two cross border train companies may also be of use for internal train journies within Wales .
First Great Western provide the bulk of cross border services between England and South Wales .
Their flagship High Speed Service generally go as far west as Swansea , and a there are even a limited number to destinations further West .
Their &quot; local &quot; services go no further west than Cardiff . Arriva Trains Cross Country provide services as far west as Cardiff .
Regular train services connect the South Wales &apos; three main cities , Cardiff , Swansea and Newport .
Services between Cardiff and Swansea are usually half hourly , and even more frequent between Cardiff and Newport .
Cardiff is also the hub of the Valley Line network which serves a number of ( former ) coal mining towns .
This railway system originally built to carry coal , is now mainly a commuter network but is useful to vistors to the Valleys , or indeed for local travel within Cardiff .
Swansea and Llanelli in the West are linked to Mid Wales via the Heart of Wales railway , whilst not a quick journey it is well worth considering for its scenery .
The First Cymru Shuttle coach service is usually quicker than the train for journies between Swansea and Cardiff , although at peak times , the train doesn &apos;t get stuck in traffic !
Depending on your own nationality , you may find it very difficult to understand the English language being spoken in a heavy Welsh accent ( sometimes Coloquially referred to as &apos; Wenglish &apos; ) - but don &apos;t be worried to ask for someone to repeat something .
Many distinct colloquialisms are used in Welsh ##AT##-##AT## English which have the potential to cause confusion to a foreigner ; a few examples of these are &apos; Aye &apos; , which is very commonly used to indicate &apos; yes &apos; and &apos; Ta ##AT##-##AT## Ra &apos; can be said instead of &apos; Goodbye &apos; ( especially in an informal conversation ) .
Welsh is spoken by some 26 % of the population ( though this varies geographically , from under 7 % in the southeast to over 60 % in the northwest ) .
Whilst in Wales as whole Welsh is a minority language , visitors should be aware that in many of those parts of Wales of paricular interest to tourists , it is in fact the majority language , with English a minority language .
A vistor should expect to come into at least basic contact with the Welsh language in all parts of Wales , if only in the form of official signage .
Where the English and Welsh names for a town are the same , only one name will appear . Visitors unfamiliar with the bilingual policy may believe that a road sign is indicating two separate destinations when in fact it is only referring to one .
Many older people , who do not speak Welsh , still have a strong emotional bond with the language , due to the fact they may have had a Welsh speaking parent or grand ##AT##-##AT## parent .
There was a time when the language was discouraged in schools and many parents refrained from speaking their native tongue with their children .
Due to 20th Century immigration , there are other langauges spoken in Wales , although their usage is limited to within small geographic areas within particular communities .
An &quot; Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty &quot; is not a government body in it &apos;s own right . They are simply areas with a similar level of protection to a National Park , but remain under the jurisdiction of the relevant Local Authority .
Like the National Park Authorities , Local Authorities with &quot; AONBs &quot; in their area do generally take their duties seriously to enforce planning laws , but unlike them , don &apos;t tend to organise any &quot; AONB &quot; branded facilities in these areas . So there don &apos;t tend to be official branded facilities such as Visitors Centres , Car Parks , and gift shops .
These facilities may exist but by conventional private , charitable and municipal provision . The actual boundaries of AONBs- whilst they are often shown on &quot; Ordnance Survey &quot; maps , tend to be of importance to local government officials and landowners , rather than tourists .
They may still have useful information , but do not expect the same level of specialisation as on a National Park website .
The Isle of Anglesey AONB- is predominantly coastal , covering most of the island &apos;s 125 miles coastline .
A range of hills running southwards from the coast at Prestatyn , Denbighshire in the north ##AT##-##AT## east of the country , close to the border with England .
The Wye Valley AONB is one of Britain &apos;s few lowland AONB &apos;s .
Blaenavon Industrial Landscape - a UNESCO World Heritage site , Blaenavon .
North Wales Castles - UNESCO World Heritage site , built in the decades after the invasion or conquest of Wales by England in the thirteenth century .
They represented the most advanced military technology of the time . They have been compared with the Crusader Castles of the Middle East .
Wales has a long golfing history , with many top ##AT##-##AT## quality courses , however it offers golf courses which tend to be less crowded , and less expensive than the other Western European destinations .
There are high quality courses of all sorts throughout Wales , both well established and recently built .
As a very rough rule North Wales tends to have the better Links courses , and the South the better parkland courses , although it is well worth playing both sorts of courses in both parts of Wales just to find out !
There is a relatively density of courses in the Vale of Glamorgan area , between Cardiff and Bridgend , due to the proliferation of course in the last fifteen years , serving the Cardiff Commuter Belt . There is also a high density of courses in the Conwy and Llandudno area .
Further details can be obtained from the Welsh Assembly Government &apos;s official golf tourism website &#91; 54 &#93; , as well as on pages concerning the specic areas of Wales .
The Celtic Manor Resort &#91; 55 &#93; - located in Newport , Monmouthshire , it has three courses , and is the venue for the 2010 Ryder Cup .
These are more generally thought of as pleasurable attractions rather than ways to get around , although the Ffestiniog Railway from Porthmadog to Blaenau Ffestiniog can be used to link places on main rail lines , and the planned extension to the Welsh Highland Railway will create a useful link between Caernarfon , Beddgelert and Porthmadog .
They are all historic lines that have been either preserved or restored and steam is a major feature on these lines .
Wales &apos; offers some spectacular coastal and mountainous scenery .
Which offers the opportunity for various activity holidays .
Cardiff &apos;s Millennium Stadium hosts two or three matches per year as part of the premier Northern Hemisphere Rugby Tournament . As well as the match itself , Cardiff will host many visitors attending the game .
Tickets and accommodation would generally need to be bought well in advance . If you are able to see a match then it is a valuable insight into Welsh culture , whether watching in a pub or in the Millennium Stadium .
See the more general article on drinking in the UK , with information on pubs and real ale .
NB : Smoking in enclosed public areas , which includes pubs and cafes , is illegal in Wales , and there is an on ##AT##-##AT## the ##AT##-##AT## spot fine of £ 50 for those who violate the ban .

As a result , many of the locals are familiar with American customs . However , as of 2006 , the military base is scheduled to close which will cause the city to lose most of its American presence .
Today Würzburg is a beautiful , historic , and lively city that is often overlooked by foreign visitors .
Würzburg is not served by an airport . However , if you fly into Frankfurt , Nuremberg or Munich , the Deutsche Bahn can get you anywhere that &apos;s worth going .
Get on an ICE train , which will take you an hour until you reach the Wuerzburger Hauptbahnhof , from Munich you will drive about 3 hours .

The local brewery , Würzburger Hofbraeu , brews excellent wheat beer ( Weissbier ) , which carries the name of a 1600s bishop of Würzburg , Julius Echter .
Basically this beer is served for you in almost all the local bars , if you order a hefe .
Würzburg resides in the middle of Franconian wineland and Frankenwein is served in many places . You can recognize the peculiar shaped bottle , Bocksbeutel , easily .

The department of Lima is located in the Middle Western part of Peru .
The western part is bordered by the Pacific Ocean and the eastern part by the Andes .
It has an extension of 33,820 km2 and the population consists of 7 million inhabitants , almost a third part of the total population of Peru .
Lima , also known as &quot; The city of the kings &quot; , was founded on the 18th of January , 1535 , on the banks of the river Rímac , by the conquistador Francisco Pizarro , chosen for its good strategic and geographic location .
The word &quot; Lima ” comes from &quot; Rímac &quot; a Quechua word that means talkative river .
During the 16th and 17th centuries also known as the period of the viceroys , Lima became the most important and powerful city in this part of the continent , and the centre for all commercial and cultural activities .
On the 28th July , 1821 , following the decline of the regime of the viceroys and a series of political movements which led to emancipation , General José de San Martin proclaimed the independence of Peru , and the period of the Republic began .
Places like Torre Tagle , Casa de Pilatos , Palacio de Osambela , Museo de la Nación , Museo Nacional de Antropología y Arqueología , Museo Nacional de Historia , Museo de Oro del Perú , Museo Amano , Museo de Arte Italiano , Museo de Arte , and the Museo Larco Herrera , show the beauty of the city &apos;s colonial architecture and allows the visitor to appreciate the entire history of the country , from the Inca Empire to the present day .
In the different museums and mansions there are permanent exhibits of ancient pottery , textiles , pre ##AT##-##AT## Hispanic gold and silver work from the colonial and republican periods .
This is an area of beaches that bring together the six districts of the capital .

The city was founded in 190 B.C. by Eumenes II , king of Pergamon .
In the 2nd and 3rd centuries , it reached the height of its development as a Roman thermal bath center .
Hierapolis has such extensive ruins which is suggested : the city walls , the octagonal Martyrium of St. Philip , the 2nd century theater , Temple of Apollo , basilica , then the necropolis which covers 2 km ² . and contains some of the best examples of tomb styles ; it is one of the best ##AT##-##AT## preserved ancient cemeteries in all of Anatolia .
In the Antiquity , Eumenes 11 , King of Pergamum , who rebuilt Hierapolis after its destruction by an earthquake , used to like bathing in the healing waters of the springs there , in a manner that planted the seed of the following concept in the soils of the Aegean lands that has survived up until now : The power lives in great splendor .
Between the first and fourth centuries , Hierapolis was a city popular with its spas in the Roman Empire .
Many queens had beauty baths in the red colored healing thermal waters of the Roman baths with soaps scented with bay leaves and , refreshed , they presented themselves to the Caesars with stalks of grapes .
In 394 it came under the control of the Byzantine Empire and became a center of Bishopric . However , when the Turks came to the area , they wanted to conquer the city and because of continuous wars between the Turks and the Byzantine , the city became a battlefield .
RadioCom 6 is a new leap forward after the successful predecessor RadioCom 5 . It is able to control several radios and significantly improve sound quality .

You can run and operate several decoders at the same time . The Digital Sound ##AT##-##AT## Processor ( DSP ) of the sound card is used .
That is why the quality is better than anything compatible . The moment RadioCom starts , some of the foremost changes are in plain view : it is distinctive and eye ##AT##-##AT## catching .

We know , this sounds like a lot of fun : - ) .
On a AM broadcast for example , you can create a completely variable IF Filter . With RadioCom 6 you can you can simply draw now multiple narrow Notch filters which oppress unwanted interferences .

the hotel is easy to find and have bus stop nearby , also walking distance to the main train station and attractions , nice settings ...
Clean , very easy to get to the center of town ( 2 stops on the bus ) and the train station ( also 2 stops ) .
I &apos;m not ever sure this should be in the negative as its partly my fault , but I thought breakfast was included and it wasn &apos;T . It was a great breakfast , but a little pricey ( 10 euros a person ) so just know that .
Close to train station , easy to find .
The amount of noise which came from the road was almost unbearable and that was from the fifth floor .
The room is located on the side of street , very noisy , very disturbing when you want to sleep . Also the room is too small .
Very noise street , old building , from outside does not look like a hotel .
When you stay longer than one night you get nicer rooms in the back of the hotel .

I think you should get in touch with the mapmakers ; finding you was not easy !
Next to subway access , clean and quiet room , fair breakfast , welcoming staff , reasonable price , free WiFi access . Perfect .
No evening meal facilities - just a vending machine selling chocolate and cold drinks . Luckily we had eaten en route , as we would not have gone out looking for somewhere to eat .
Le bruit extérieur : difficile de dormir avant 23h30 et réveil A ... 5h30 les 2 jours de suite !

good access to city and tourist stuff. however best was the back streets of Montmartre for food , drinks and fashion .
The big bathroom with bathtub and working shower / bath facilities .
The area is lively , near Montmartre and is right next to Moulin Rouge and the Blanche Metro Station .
The room allocated to us was on the 1st floor , just beside the dining area .
As such , there was too much noise from early morning as the staff started to prepare for breakfast .
Le Chat Noir was a great value for a Paris hotel . Not only was it affordable the hotel was very nice , clean rooms , modern design , and extremely nice and helpful staff .
Bathrooms do not have shower curtains or doors - although I think this is pretty standard for Europe .
I like the ambience of the room and the furniture was new and well maintained .
There is no kettle for us to boil water for our own consumption .
I have appreciated the comfort of my room , the peacefulness of the hotel , the seesight ( Eiffel Tower only for us !
) , and the breakfast in a very zen room .
A shower would be more pratical .
The location is perfect , just beside Moulin Rouge , in the heart of Montmartre .
The rooms are as nice as they look in the pictures .

Position of hotel on the banks of the Loire ; beautiful views across to the Chateau and no road noise . Easy and picturesque 5 ##AT##-##AT## 10 minute stroll along the riverbank , across the bridge to the centre of town .
Where it was situated was excellent for our trip this time , the food was good and there were resturants over the bridge to give a walk in the evening .
Awkward car parking but ok provided Hotel is not full .
The lack of a Restaurant and offering snacks only as part of room service , is not what I would have expected from a hotel of this quality . The high price charged for the buffet breakfast , was not matched by what was on offer and the indifferent service .
Helpfulness of receptionist upon our arrival on Saturday afternoon and decor of Reception seemed promising - but room not so much !

The convenience of the location is the main draw of Ascot Hyde Park Hotel .
It was very noisy ( a price to pay for the convenience ) but the shower head that didn &apos;t quite work properly was more frustrating .
I have stayed at other Ascot group hotels both in and out of London and I must say the Ascot Hyde Park Hotel didn &apos;t quite match up with the standards .
On one of the reviews it said that wi ##AT##-##AT## fi only worked on the ground floor and the basement so I e ##AT##-##AT## mailed a week before to check this out - I was reassured that wi fi worked on every floor - NOT TRUE - it only works on the ground floor and the awful dungeon of a basement where they serve breakfast .
Facilities are old and worn down in the old wing . Carpet was worn down , hair dryer on fire .
Lift not available in new wing though room are much nicer as can see it &apos;s been newly refurbished .
facilities near the hotel like the tube station and restaurants .
Extremely well located - 2 minute walk from Paddington Station .
the noise just never stops ! ! you can clearly here the next room guests and if anyone walks on the stairs or anywere even far away from your room either upstairs or in your floor you could here the loud steps sound ! !
The Location is steps away form the Paddington Station , freindly staff , Clean rooms , rooms are bigger than other hotels in the same area . , free internet is a big plus .
very poor facilities . Our room was located in a seperate block , the front door of which had no lock and smelt of gas in the entrance .
Winding little stairs led to the room with no lift !
One member of staff who was passing did help with our case . Breakfast was poor and even necessitated in boiling your own kettle for a cup of tea !

There was no room for us to stay there , even though I had given my credit card number and made the reservation . The response from the hotel was that there were many clients who wanted to extend their stay .
The room was a bit stuffy , a fan of some sorts would have been nice to move the air around .
Great location . Not the most modern but clean and comfortable .
Staff friendly , having breakfast included in price is a welcome touch .
The best things about the Astor Court Hotel is its location and its friendly staff .
The most annoying was the state of the bathroom -- a yellow toilet seat , a hole burned in the floor by a cigarette , one towel with a huge dark stain .
The faucet and shower were completely unpredictable . First 10 minutes I got only cold water , then it was nearly boiling .
its location was perfect for oxford street , breakfast was good .
very convenient didnt have to get any public transport .
we had a family apartment type room which was very spacious .
the hotel was very quiet and peaceful .

The room was small and very aged , hadn &apos;t been updated in a long time .
Hotel had no lift for guests had to use the service lift.The room was too hot and no air con.Bathroom facilities were poor . No milk in the room for tea or coffee .
The only good thing about this hotel is its central location .
The lift was a safety hazard , no air conditioning in the room , windows did not fully open , scaffolding outside the hotel , very noisy both morning and night , sink in the bedroom , the staff were not very helpfull .
It was so hot while we were there some ac would be nice .
The fan in the room wasn &apos;t alot of use .
Excellent location at Hyde Park and close to everything .
No hot water in the morning . Ground floor room with poor window latches made me afraid the room would be broken into .
The location was good . It was easy to get to on the public transport .
The staff did try to answer my questions.The breakfast was good .
There was no air conditioning and I would like to have a refridgertor in the room . The staff did not really know a lot about the area .
I thought the staff were friendly and the hotels location for attractions was great ! ! ! ! !
Whilst this isn &apos;t a complaint , there was a lot of construction / building noise during our stay .
It didn &apos;t bother us too much , but it might be an idea to advise cutomers on booking that ongoing refurbishment work is in progress .
A minor point , our double bed was actually 2 singles pushed together creating an uncomfortable join down the middle !

What i did not like was the mis selling from your company . Firstly the location was 20 min walk from the centre of edinburgh and had I known this in advance would have booked the roxburgh hotel .

Helpful and very nice staff . Within walking distance of Princess Street .
The central location &amp; car parking , good quality rooms &amp; service .
The comfort and the easy access to the centre of Edinburgh .

there was no higher building next to hotel so view from our room was nice .
I understand the hotel is old but didn &apos;t like that it makes sounds when we walk in the room .
The service was appalling . I called the front desk to ask what the weather forecast was for the day and was told to go buy a newspaper !
Our room was like a sauna ( a fan was supplied but still it was stuffy ) and the toilet was blocked .
the room I stayed in was so HOT - The radiator was not even on !
Restaurant serves excellent meals but lacks variety in choice . Overall better than other hotels I &apos;ve stayed at in the same area ..
They want money upfront ... made me feel very uncomfortable . Having booked the hotel through credit cards why would they need upfront payment .
Is it because they think there guests will run away without paying ... Hotel Management should seriously look into this issue and make there guests feel comfortable .

Great service , nice breakfasts , club room was excellent .

the location was central and the room was extremely comfortable although perhaps a little smaller than i would have expected . It was very clean and well presented .
It was quite difficult to find .
room a little cramped , small window in corner did not allow much natural light in to room , very hot with poor ventilation which meant air conditioning had to be on all the time ( during May ) .

Coming from Japan where all hotels always have basic amenities ( toothbrush , shaver , ... ) , we expected to find some , even though this is not customary in Europe . There was however a well ##AT##-##AT## appointed set of toiletries for ladies .
The breakfast was poor and overly expensive at 25 euros - 5 star prices for 3 star quality . This was the only thing I could fault the hotel for .
At the arrival the receptionist asked for the whole deposit of the amount to be paid for my stay plus 100 guarantee in cash , since I did not have a credit card.When I told the receptionist that I did not have that amount on me that moment , but I could pay immediately for the room , she was very rude and very reluctant to give a key to my room .

was not particularly good , but I suspect any improvement would require a major constructional task .
It &apos;s great for short business trips , tourism around The Hague and all that . Be aware that the area can seem a bit secluded , but is really close to everything and The Hague doesn &apos;t really have a &quot; downtown &quot; area ( it &apos;s far from a shopping city ) .
I had to change rooms twice . The first room assigned to me was not cleaned , the second people had smoked in .
Free wi ##AT##-##AT## fi internet and the breakfast are worth the appreciation .
There wasn &apos;t anyone at the reception when I arrived and checked out . I had to wait for about 10 minutes and ring the bell thrice upon arrival and it was same when I wanted to check out .

Easy to transport to old city or Gaia district .
I have stayed at this hotel every year since 1999 . Surely that &apos;s a recommendation in itsefl ?
Breakfast was ok but for my likes etc just a bit more of English breakfast .
Excellent breakfast , all was clean . Very important for cold weather , were warm rooms .
The hotel is in a narrow old street , and does not look impressive from the outside .
However we were delighted with the quaintness of the hotel which is 3 buildings joined together , creating lots of interesting spaces which have been turned into themed sitting rooms .

The quality of facilities was first class , staff were extremely efficient and helpful , location was very good . Soundproofing was excellent , room cleaning was exemplary .
Clean , good quality hotel with excellent breakfast arrangements .
Opening the window makes the life miserable because of the outside noise ##AT##-##AT## even on the oposite side of the main entrance . Unfortunately roof located air conditioning systems installed on other buildings , are very noisy .
We made use of spa club which is sauna ( that was unfortunately closed for repairs ) , turkish bath and jacuzzi . We enjoyed the piano player in the evenings in the main hall .
Lack of security . The price of drinks in the bar was high - hence there was hardly anyone in the bar so no atmosphere .

Es scheint , als ob das Hotel derzeit renoviert wird , dafür war es OK und man wurde nicht gestört .
Alakerran vastaanoton yhteydessä toimivassa ravintolassa ( ei varsinainen ruokaravintola ) tarjottiin erityisesti meitä varten tehty herkullinen lihalautanen salaatteineen . Siitä erityisesti kiitokset !
Vastaanotossa oli lähtöpäivänä vaikeuksia saada matkatavaroita loppupäiväksi säilytykseen , vaikka siitä oli sovittu edellisenä päivänä . Ikkunat ulvoivat tuulisena päivänä voimakkaasti .
La pulizia delle stanze , la struttura dell &apos;hotel , la cordialità del personale , la bontà del cibo e il suo ottimo rapporto con il prezzo , la quantità delle colazioni , la posizione comoda al centro , la comodità del parcheggio , la tranquliità della posizione , l &apos;ampiezza delle stanze e dei bagni .
Nella mia stanza ( la 213 , ma so che nelle altre non era così ) entrava la luce per due motivi : le tende blu che coprono le finestre non sono sufficientemente ampie , e sopra la porta della camera c &apos;è una finestra alta e non oscurabile che al mattino rendeva davvero molto fastidiosa la luce .
Ultimo aspetto il fatto che la doccia non avesse protezione attorno e che quindi si bagnasse tutto il bagno .
Zur Zeit sind Renovierungsarbeiten im Hotel .

Close to un where I went for a conference .
It would have been desirable with the ability to freshen up a bit after the city tour , for us who had little time for sightseeing before we were to travel to the airport .
The Hotel location was excellent for central New York , the available facilities in the proximity of the hotel are an added bonus , the room was excellent .
I arrived hotel at 10 pm and there was no booking record . Hotel reception asked me to call booking.com but it wasn &apos;t office hour ( didn &apos;t take any responsibility ) .
Finally , he offered me a standard room although I booked a junior suite for 3 people .
Room seemed small for the amount it cost per night .
The hotel &apos;s location was very central making it easy to travel around the well known landmarks .
very convenient location ##AT##-##AT## walking distance to most tourist sites and to 5th avenue and Macys .

Polite and attentive staff , good rooms , an excellent restaurant , centraql location for UN staff ( myself included ) .
I really enjoyed the friendly service from both hotel and restaurant staff .
Our room was a wonderful size and I couldn &apos;t of asked for more comfortable bedding .
As a first time guest , I was extremely disappointed that there wasn &apos;t a restaurant on the roof top as indicated on the website displayed on booking.com.

Cleanliness of apartment , hotel staff was friendly . There was a binder for us with important information , city information , tourist information .

1. the noise and parties at some apartments during nights , when no one from the office is there so you have to suffer or to deal with it yourself 2. no television in English besides CNN and sports 3 .

Improved mechanical properties of the final product as well as significant savings in material costs and energy .
These are just a few of the advantages of injection ##AT##-##AT## moulding compounding .
ENGEL , in co ##AT##-##AT## operation with the Nuremberg ##AT##-##AT## based extrusion specialist Leistritz , have now developed a 2 ##AT##-##AT## colour injection ##AT##-##AT## moulding compounder .
The ENGEL duo machine with an integrated ZSE MAXX extruder makes it possible to continuously and directly introduce the compounded material into the injection moulding process .
The ENGEL advantage : if required , the injection moulding machine can also be operated independently of the extruder for standard injection moulding processes .
During compounding , different thermoplastics and other materials are prepared with additives using synchronous twin ##AT##-##AT## screw extruders .
Depending on the additive , the material receives specific characteristics which determine the properties of the final product .
In injection ##AT##-##AT## moulding compounding , this process is integrated directly into the injection moulding process .
Here , the extruder transports the plasticized material through heated melt lines into the barrel .
During injection and the post ##AT##-##AT## injection pressure , the mass is put into intermediate storage in a melt pot .
Due to this in ##AT##-##AT## line compounding , the product does not have to undergo another round of energetic stress ; this results both in an economic advantage – up to 50 % power reduction – and often in improved mechanical properties of the final product .
For example , the length of glass fibres is generally retained .
Accordingly , the areas of application are mainly in the automobile industry , but also in the areas of packing ( pallets , boxes ) and in processing natural fibres .
In co ##AT##-##AT## operation with the Nuremberg ##AT##-##AT## based Leistritz Extrusionstechnik GmbH , ENGEL have now developed a 2 ##AT##-##AT## colour injection ##AT##-##AT## moulding compounder .
Integrated in a 1000 t duo machine , the ENGEL injection ##AT##-##AT## moulding compounder offers a number of advantages .
For example , when the machine is used as a &quot; universal machine &quot; , it can also carry out the functions of a standard injection ##AT##-##AT## moulding machine .
Multi ##AT##-##AT## component applications can be provided very easily due to the construction and high degree of flexibility of the Leistritz ZSE MAXX extruder series with the help of a piggy ##AT##-##AT## back unit .
The sequence – with standard plasticization , a melt buffer ( with the ENGEL post ##AT##-##AT## injection pressure technique ) and a twin ##AT##-##AT## screw extruder – allows the compounder to process continuously , making it also suitable for difficult compounding jobs .
Other advantages : the low height and the simple ( decoupled ) arrangement with optimal possibilities for automation .
As a result , the machine is easier to access for maintenance work ; due to the separate side ##AT##-##AT## by ##AT##-##AT## side construction , vibration effects on plasticizing are eliminated .
Particularly today , when increasing prices for raw materials force manufacturers to again and again think about alternatives , the injection ##AT##-##AT## moulding compounder is an ideal solution .
The double value added as a result of ( plastic ) shaping AND material preparation represents a significant advantage .
Furthermore , with the help of compounding that is integrated in the injection moulding process , the user can build up his own recipe know ##AT##-##AT## how and can also cheaply create small batches with special compounds .

Against a backdrop of accelerated processes , growing internationality and increasing order volumes , it ’ s important to have a dependable partner . The EOS Group has been offering services in the fields of information management , arrears management and receivables management for more than 30 years .
The concept of capital sharing is popular througho ....
Hamburg – Creditors find defaulting payers easier ....
As an international financial services provider , EOS combines its companies ’ regional competence with the Group ’ s overall expertise .
That is the purpose of this document : to outline the party &apos;s vision of the future of Europe and the World and our response to it as a union of political parties - fighting for a Union of Values - heading towards a real Union of citizens .
Every person counts . The future development of the Union must have at its core the freedom and dignity of the human person .
This is the only base on which we can build popular support for the process of integration . We must create a Union which protects and promotes common European values ; and in which fundamental rights are respected and no form of discrimination is accepted .
In order to give priority to the needs of children , and respect the equality of men and women , legislative and economic measures must be developed which enable parents to strike an appropriate balance between family and work commitments . The Party supports all measures to improve the position of children .
The party rejects all forms of racism , xenophobia , or social exclusion ; considers that , on grounds of social justice and solidarity , it is the duty of the State to meet basic needs where the individual is unable to do so ; and endorses the Charter of Fundamental Rights , which sets out both the rights and responsibilities of Union citizenship . Rejecting social exclusion the party will support the smaller and natural units in the civil society , from the individual and the family to the associations of civil society .
Consequently all citizens must have access to the basic services of healthcare , old ##AT##-##AT## age pension provision , housing , and education .
Common rules on asylum policy in the European Union , based on the Geneva Convention , with a fair distribution of asylum seekers and refugees among EU Member States are of decisive importance for the EPP . On the other hand adequate measures must be taken to deal with the increasing abuses which cannot be tolerated within the Union .
A transparent , planned approach to immigration and integration , taking account of the Member States ´ capacity to receive and integrate immigrants , is needed for those who come to live and work in the Union . The Member States should elaborate an active policy to integrate immigrants who have entered the state legally .
A controlled immigration policy must also embrace political and economic cooperation with the countries of origin , the fight against illegal immigration and an effective mechanism for surveillance of external borders . Europe is a pluralist culture in function of the unity of its values .
The population of Europe is living longer because of medical advances and falling birth rates , so that social security needs to be adapted to these changes .
Clear and resolute support of the family , stimulating political and economic support for childcare and children ´ s education would help to rejuvenate Europe and to turn around the current drop in birth rates .
We believe that extending one &apos;s working life should be offered as a possibility in future .
Ageism is a form of discrimination which is as unacceptable as other forms of discrimination . We have to encourage private initiative and the non ##AT##-##AT## commercial sector .
Organised crime and terrorism must be efficiently and jointly fought because they represent a serious threat to the peoples of a united Europe . We demand more rigour in the struggle against the most dangerous crimes and in particular such as the exploitation of prostitution and paedophilia .
The political challenge ahead is to build an enlarged European Union based on common principles and values , a Union which puts the concerns of people at the centre of its work .
A Union based on enterprise and social justice and care for the environment will enable us to fulfill that dream which is now , for the first time , within our grasp .
For the EPP , employment is more than just ensuring material existence . It is also a decisive factor of self ##AT##-##AT## achievement and it opens up the opportunity of participating in the construction of society .
The Single European Currency is an important factor in a period of economic dynamism driven by global competition , technological advance , and ever ##AT##-##AT## wider acceptance of the market economy .
Elimination of exchange ##AT##-##AT## rate fluctuations and removal of competitive devaluations between Member States .
Even before circulating as cash , the euro has improved the availability of capital , reduced costs , enhanced competition , and increased productivity .
It has also softened the impact of external financial crises .
204 . The independence of the ECB is vital to the success of the EURO and any attempts to subdue it should be strongly rejected .
Its independence and the clear strategy in favour of price stability is the one single biggest improvement of economic policy making of the last century .
But management of monetary policy should become more transparent and have more coherent external representation . This will strengthen the euro &apos;s standing as a global currency .
There is a need for prudential control of the banking system on an EU level .
The Central Bank ´ s neutral money policy must be balanced by a more coordinated economic policy on the part of Member States . But this must not lead to a single economic policy .
Balanced budgets as an obligation of the Pact of Stability and Growth need to be achieved by lowering expenditure rather than increased taxes .
Budget surpluses should primarily be used to reduce debt and taxation . The favourable economic trend should be exploited to create margins of manoeuvre , for instance to deal with the growing problem of an ageing European population .
It is also to a large extent a political project . The Euro is a policy of peace for the 21st century by monetary means .
The credibility and the confidence which the euro should enjoy as a major international reserve currency will also depend on the EU &apos;s capacity to better coordinate its economic policies , which is an essential condition for convergence and the joint achievement by the Member States , acting jointly , of price stability and growth objectives .
The promotion of the European economy presupposes the improvement and development of infrastructure for all modes of transport , and in particular the extension of the trans ##AT##-##AT## European transport network to the candidate states of Central and Eastern Europe .
As a general rule , resources must not be taken from growing areas of the economy to preserve old jobs , but must be concentrated on providing opportunities for training and specialization . Sustainability demands that we invest our credits in the future and alleviate the social impact of a sector whose time is past rather than maintaining no ##AT##-##AT## hope ##AT##-##AT## sectors .
The state ´ s obligation to provide some public services for people must not be unduly restricted by European rules .
The local , regional and national communities must be enabled to decide about the services they provide for its citizens .
This is an important part of the European model and forms part of the political scope of local and regional authorities .
Hence , cutting subsidies and real liberalisation of , for example , the postal service , the railway systems , banking , housing , and waste management sectors will bring the public welfare witnessed in the telecom and electricity markets .
Innovation . Freedom is also freedom for enterprise .
The human person is at the centre of our view of the new economy .
We must combat materialistic thinking , reducing the human person to a consumer or a client . Personal initiative is the most important element in generating work and wealth for everybody .
Europe &apos;s best chance of a permanently high level of exports and low unemployment is to create new , high value ##AT##-##AT## added , products or services . Europe cannot , over the long term , compete with low ##AT##-##AT## wage countries manufacturing products which do not incorporate advanced technology .
The EPP is against subsidizing loss ##AT##-##AT## making enterprises on such pretexts as maintaining employment . This distorts the market and diverts resource from research , training , and investment in competitive enterprises .
General telecoms policy should seek to support the liberalization and privatization of markets , so that increased competition can bring down prices and encourage the growth of the IT economy .
All EU governments can learn from successes beyond their own borders . Therefore there should be EU bench marking studies on all these factors measuring not the state expenses but the effectiveness of each euro spent .
Policies aimed at creating durable new jobs .
Non ##AT##-##AT## labour costs are one of the major causes of unemployment , especially amongst unskilled workers .
Such burdens need to be reduced by cutting social security costs through improved management of social security expenditure and by reducing people &apos;s tendency to think in terms of what entitlements they can claim .
Wage increases must be clearly related to increased productivity .
The EPP therefore supports initiatives and derogations which free SMEs from excessively burdensome administrative regulation , and encourage them to recruit staff as SMEs are the one most important single source of job growth in Europe . Part ##AT##-##AT## time work while safeguarding social protection equal to full ##AT##-##AT## time work should also be encouraged for men and women , both as an element of flexible labour and as a means of reconciling work with family life .
In a knowledge ##AT##-##AT## based society the opportunity of education is the key to progress and equality and sustainability .
For the EPP it is not only a way of becoming more competitive .
Education and training need to be widened as a concept and as a policy area , and to be understood as a lifelong process and a personal investment .
The transmission of Europe &apos;s humanistic heritage to new generations must be an essential task of the educational system .
This can be encouraged by special education savings accounts .
The demands both of academia and industry must be met . A close co ##AT##-##AT## operation with the labour market is necessary in order to match education and needs .
Universities and other scientific and technological institutions must be given better possibilities , both for education and for research .
Since education policy remains the responsibility of the nation states and regions , the European Union shall focus its policies on the extension of its exchange andresearch programmes .
These programmes are essential in providing opportunities for students and scholars to mutually exchange information , which is decisive for high ##AT##-##AT## quality research and high ##AT##-##AT## quality learning and teaching .
The European Union should take initiatives aimed at getting member states to agree on a division of work .
The most advanced resources have to be concentrated in order to create the scientific environments needed .
Systems for the mutual recognition of degrees such as ECTS shall be extended to all sectors of education .
In order to achieve the success of its mobility ##AT##-##AT## schemes , the European Commission shall implement a policy to remove remaining bureaucratic obstacles enforced by the Member States .
Schools must give each student a solid base for continuous learning .
School education of the highest quality will be more important than before .
This means that more emphasis must be put on understanding , problem solving and the evaluation of information .
The family must be encouraged to work as a vehicle of education and assistance to the individual in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity .
Initiative and independence are a key to success in modern society .
This principle should also apply to the education system .
The state should encourage a variety of both schools and of teaching methods .
Students must be given the right to choose their school based on their own interests .
A European ##AT##-##AT## wide system of school choice should be encouraged as well as a system which enables university students at European level to select the university of their preference .
Europe will have no meaning unless it is both an economic and social Europe .
conditions of globalized markets and rapid industrial change .
The challenge is to combine powerful new market forces with humanity - economic dynamism with social responsibility - in the way we organise our social security systems .
The EPP believes this is possible and essential to more favourable combine conditions for entrepreneurship and economic dynamism with social responsibility .
We will therefore seek to reform and modernise European social security systems .
Social peace must be based on social partnership , which covers participation and joint responsibility of the social partners as well as of the government .
The EPP supports negotiations between social partners on framework agreements at European Union level . These agreements should be made legally binding for the Union as a whole .
The main responsibility for social security lies with the member states .
The EPP however , welcomes the fact that member states exchange their experiences at European level and diminish - wherever possible - existing qualitative differences between the systems of social security .
Following the principle of subsidiarity , the Union must take those responsibilities in this field which cannot be dealt with by the member state alone . On the international level the European Union should actively promote a strengthening of social standards .
Within the framework of the World Trade Organisation internationally binding rules on competition and codes of conduct in the fields of social , ecological and human rights standards must be progressively developed .
The other special concern is also more familiar : the poor and the marginalised .
Generally speaking our modern society is very prosperous . Nevertheless the division of society between rich and poor must be overcome .
The EPP believes that individuals have a duty to take responsibility for themselves , and to earn a living if they can . We are equally committed to the belief that a just society helps the helpless .
While acknowledging their shifting importance , the EPP accepts the legitimate and useful role of the social partnership of trade unions and employers &apos; organisations in creating durable employment . The EPP &apos;s attitude to work goes beyond mere jobs .
The inseparable connection between economic and social order becomes particularly clear in the endeavour to bring as many people as possible into work . Therefore the EPP is convinced that working conditions which offend human dignity must be prevented in the same way as the temptation to regard work only as a matter of price .
At the same time it means the obligation of the European Union as a whole as well as of every Member State to fight unemployment and strive actively for more employment . In this context the EPP strongly emphasises the procedure of European employment guidelines implemented by Christian Democrats , which combine common objectives - the obligation to take concrete measures as well as the exchange of experiences .
Though industrial expansion has generated unprecedented economic gains there are many related environmental costs that have yet to be paid .
The challenge is to bring harmony between economic growth , social development , and environmental concerns .
Hence , the need for public interventions to integrate environmental costs .
Information technology increases the potential of the person . The EPP supports the freedoms which are embodied in such potentials .
Equality demands that everyone be given the opportunity to profit from the new possibilities .
Information technology results in greater productivity .
New jobs will be created wherever there is systematic training and education in the new technology .
E ##AT##-##AT## commerce in particular is developing exponentially as an efficient market mechanism , and enhancing sound economic management .
All barriers to e ##AT##-##AT## commerce within the EU should be eliminated .
Joint European action needs to be taken on security of contracts , confidentiality , and signature authentication ; measures are also needed to prevent tax evasion or fraud , in particular regarding transactions based on non ##AT##-##AT## localised services ; and also against use of new technology for money ##AT##-##AT## laundering , illegal trafficking of humans , drugs , and prostitution .
Technically , the European telecommunications market , until 15 years ago divided into national markets dominated by state monopolies , has largely been deregulated and integrated thanks to EU initiatives .
These have also ensured that the GSM standard has become the dominant standard ; for the same reason the UMTS standard will soon achieve a leading position .
The information and knowledge society brings about many new opportunities . It is important to make these opportunities available to all citizens .
Therefore member states and the EU should redouble their efforts to encourage dissemination of new information technology . Europe should aid developing countries to participate in the world of Information Society .
New and more direct forms of relationship between citizens and politics will emerge , bringing public administration , parties and the political actors closer to European citizens . The new technologies will bring new ways of conducting politics , from collecting funds to following political rallies through the Net from any part of the world .
The EPP supports the implementation of electronic voting as an option in the next European elections , and progressively at a national , regional , and local level .
The EPP will strive to use the new technology to give citizens full and updated information about its political work .
It will also strive to simplify the means of communication between voters and our politicians at all levels .
We believe that technological innovation opens up new possibilities for an intensified and meaningful democratic dialogue in society .
Administration on line . Administration at all levels should be able to relate with the citizens as quickly as possible .
Paying taxes , applying for a position in the public sector , or resolving &quot; red tape &quot; questions , should be possible for everyone via the Internet . This will also ensure greater transparency in politics .
Bio ##AT##-##AT## ethics poses a special challenge to the EPP .
The free of movement of people , goods , capital , and services in the European Union affects the possibilities of national governments to guarantee the dignity of human life in the field of bio ##AT##-##AT## technology .
Therefore , there is reason for involvement of the European Union in setting common legal standards concerning the protection of the dignity of human life and the responsibility of bio ##AT##-##AT## medical research .
EPP policy is an alternative to uncritical support for technological developments , in which the human embryo is seen as an instrument , an alternative to the politics of endorsing unlimited individual self ##AT##-##AT## realisation , and an alternative to the policy of closing doors to any new development . This attitude runs the risk of being overtaken by reality , and as a result influence on research and the ethical debate could be minimal .
All individuals must be protected at every stage of life , from conception to death , particularly if they are weak , handicapped , or powerless .
Human life , in whatever form , whatever its appearance or capacity , is dignified in itself .
Any deliberate form of eugenics must be banned .
In the field of biotechnology , without using cells from living embryos experiments on human embryos should only be permitted if they are designed to protect the life and health of the specific embryo which is the subject of the experiment , as is the case with all other human individuals .
Very strict world ##AT##-##AT## wide rules should be adopted . The EPP is in favour of enhanced and joint efforts to promote pre ##AT##-##AT## conception research techniques which will make research on embryos unnecessary , and of encouraging scientific research in the field of artificial insemination , which avoids the serious problem of overproduction of embryos .
Commercial exploitation of human embryos must be forbidden in all cases .
Research in the fields of bio ##AT##-##AT## medicine and bio ##AT##-##AT## technology promoted by the European Union , and the resources provided by the Commission for bio ##AT##-##AT## medical research , should be granted in accordance with the ethical principles set out above .
Food marked as biologically produced must proof that this claim is absolutely valid , preferably by established EU standards controlled at national level . Europeans have a right to accurate information on product ingredients , particularly GMOs .
Therefore , correct labelling of foodstuffs which allows consumer choice must be the priority . Consumers need to be better educated and given current information on the scientific aims , GMOs and their effects on food quality , health and the environment .
The EPP therefore believes that new thinking must be supported , by promoting the potential of traditional agriculture and particularly by realising the value of typical traditional quality products . The EPP supports encouraging young farmers and diversifying production to satisfy consumer demand .
In Central and Eastern Europe , an unthinking policy of modernisation will mostly serve to drive people from the land , and add to the glut of food in Europe .
Information Technology offers enormous opportunities to rural areas . As information is available everywhere , the role of the centres fades .
The EPP firmly supports a pro ##AT##-##AT## active policy for rural areas to make use of these opportunities .
Rural depopulation , and the general malaise on the land affects everyone , including urban dwellers , disrupting their quality of life and even their sense of identity . The EPP is against a subsidized theme ##AT##-##AT## park policy to the land , and favours policies which encourage a genuine rural economy .
This will necessarily include more light industry in farming areas .
Traditional agriculture in order both to improve the quality of agricultural products for human and animal feed , to protect consumers from unsafe innovations and to promote consumers &apos; consciousness remains a very important branch of the economy .
Agriculture is not an ordinary branch of industry . Agriculture is more than just producing goods .
Agriculture is culture in rural areas . Therefore we support and defend the concept of multi functional agriculture .
There is a difference in farm sizes , social and environmental regulations etc . The EU farmers must be prepared to cope with world markets in a way which enables them to cope with this challenge .
The choice for the European Union is the result of history , and a response to the challenges of the future .
- make a contribution to a better world .
As a legal community , the European Union safeguards peace , enhances the interdependence of nations , and creates the conditions for their welfare and prosperity . The challenge for the future is to create a new form of political organisation .
Europe must have the capacity to act if it is to safeguard the nation as a way of life . This is the basic condition for its acceptance by our citizens .
Increasing diversity and a mounting work load ask for streamlining activities if the essential tasks are to be fulfilled . A lean Europe is built on self ##AT##-##AT## governance by local and regional authorities and the enduring power of the nation state .
All three elements - a capacity to act , a restriction of action to certain key tasks , and democratic procedures - form the bases of Europe &apos;s legitimacy and are an integral part of its identity .
In all these respects , Europe epitomizes not the disintegration but the evolution of its constituent nations .
Europe must further develop its existing common cultural and political identity .
Europe defines itself in equal measure through its common intellectual and spiritual heritage , its diverse national origins , and its will for a common future . European civil society must be reinforced .
Civil initiatives for social purposes have to be encouraged . The ties between individuals have to be strengthened .
The EPP considers that the establishment of a European cultural area centred on respect for and promotion of cultural and linguistic diversity contributes to the ideal of the European Union , namely to unite the citizens and peoples of Europe in respect for their culture and their national and regional traditions .
Europe &apos;s future is not merely an extension of the national origin . As Europe is a new form of political organisation , sole , ultimate , or universal responsibility will no longer exist at any level .
Europe will not be a federation in the conventional sense , but a new form of federal system , of which economic and monetary union is the precursor . This unique form of political organisation will follow the objectives of federalism and the community method .
European federalism is based on solidarity between Member States but also on competition in order to establish best practices .
The aim is to learn from each other and to establish Europe as a learning community .
Economic and monetary union has centralized just one element - monetary policy - of one key area of public policy , the economy .
The others , in contrast to a traditional federation , remain the responsibility of participating states .
The fundamental expression of solidarity in EMU is adherence to the rules agreed in the Maastricht Treaty which aim to modernise and revitalise European economies and societies . But within this framework Member States are free to decide how to achieve this goal .
Member States have to be given enough room for manoeuvre to adapt themselves to new challenges in respect of their specific problems , needs , and experiences . Harmonisation in the field of economic policy must ensure that a level playing field will come about for economic actors .
The division of competences has to be clear , precise , transparent and dynamic over time . The citizen has to know who is responsible for what in Europe .
The European People &apos;s Party advocates a thoroughgoing institutional reform which will ensure the proper functioning of the Union while taking account of the values of freedom , democracy , responsibility , equality , justice , solidarity , subsidiarity , the rule of law and accountability which are the values guiding its political action .
The European Union has need of a constitutional treaty to define the decision ##AT##-##AT## making procedures among the European institutions and the allocation of powers between the European Union and the individual Member States , in accordance with the subsidiarity principle .
This constitutional treaty must also include a Charter of Fundamental Rights .
This constitutional treaty , which should be able to be adopted by the peoples of Europe in accordance with the most democratic procedures , should be drafted by a Convention similarly composed as the Convention for the Charter on Fundamental Rights .
The enlargement of the union represents an opportunity to safeguard freedom and democracy in those parts of Europe where dictatorship previously destroyed the lives of millions of people .
An enlarged union is an important opportunity to secure peace in our part of the world .
This process gives rise to a certain fluidity of boundaries .
The borders of the EU will be the result of a political process of shaping a self ##AT##-##AT## confident European community whose members share a common sentiment of belonging and acting together .
At the same time the Union has to develop a coherent strategy for the policy towards their neighbouring countries , which are bound to become important partners .
In many cases relations based on the specific needs and interests seem to be much more appropriate than membership .
The EU is a global economic player but very weak in other areas of foreign policy , notably security , intelligence , and sometimes even diplomacy . This imbalance creates a dichotomy in public attitudes to the EU and contains latent potential for conflict .
The EPP recognizes that the European Union can only survive as a political project if it evolves into a Union with a dynamic Common Foreign , Security , and Defence policy . The EPP believes that politics have a general responsibility in establishing a framework regulating liberalisation and globalization to pass from growth to welfare for all .
It is an absolute necessity if globalization is to be accepted by all countries and peoples . Cooperation must be promoted between the WTO and other international institutions , including the Bretton Woods institutions , ILO and other UN organisations , with a view to attaining a more consistent approach to trade , social , monetary , financial , ecological and political issues .
Europe is a model for the rest of the world in legally regulating cooperation between free and self ##AT##-##AT## confident nations , and in safeguarding peace to their mutual benefit as a response to supranational reality .
Europe is the most advanced project of political integration , and the Europeans can be proud of their achievement .
In the long term , a better world cannot be based on hegemony , a balance of power , or deterrence .
Europe can - and must - make a major contribution to the urgent task of developing globally binding rules in areas ranging from security policy to the environment and the economy .
The United Nations must therefore be strengthened through comprehensive organizational and structural reform .
It can contribute much to the gradual process of replacing anarchy around the world with the rule of law , as it did in Europe itself .
The EPP supports a fundamental reform of the UN and a single Security Council seat for the European Union .
The development policy of the European Union and its Member States is the expression of Europe &apos;s solidarity with other parts of the world .
Moreover , Europe - the EU and its Member States - must be the advocate and champion of its development policy partners within the bodies of international organisations . The arms trade is one area where Europe has a particular responsibility towards the safeguarding of human rights internationally .
Governments must ensure that profits made from the arms trade are not gained at the expense of human rights .
For its part , Europe will take its responsibility .
The EPP strongly urges all Member States to meet the internationally agreed standard to devote 0,7 % of their gross domestic product to development aid .
The European Union should open its markets further to import products from developing countries .
This is fundamental in helping poor nations to combat poverty .
In a globalized world , the impact of wars and conflicts is more difficult to contain .
Deterrence and conflict preventionare the real purposes of the armed forces .
The EPP calls on the Commission to submit budgetary proposals to the Member States so that investment expenditure in the field of new military communications and transport technology can be planned jointly , thereby reducing unit costs and increasing the operational capacity of the future European army .
Together , EU Member States have armed forces which numerically exceed those of the US .
There should be greater and more consistent investment in European armed forces since these increasingly threaten to become second rate armies .
Now that the Cold War is over , it is paradoxical that the countries which decided to combine their destinies within the European Union are finding it easier to reach an agreement on preserving peace outside the Union ( the &quot; Petersburg missions &quot; ) than on the joint defence of the security of the Union itself .
The security of Europe also requires the improvement of our co ##AT##-##AT## operation in civil crisis ##AT##-##AT## management , such as police and rescue operations .
The EU therefore must be provided with a common police ##AT##-##AT## force . Further , it is desirable that Europe improves its co ##AT##-##AT## operation in crisis ##AT##-##AT## prevention and democratic institution ##AT##-##AT## building .
Democratic ideals have now taken root in the eastern part of Europe .
Europe and America are jointly extending the Euro ##AT##-##AT## Atlantic structures of the EU and NATO to this region in order to safeguard long ##AT##-##AT## term peace , stability , and welfare there too .
Both partners are also seeking to help Russia and Ukraine to find their place in Europe .
The key strategic project in shaping Europe as a whole is eastward enlargement of the EU . The institutional guarantee of peace and stability is the EU &apos;s greatest challenge and it requires American support .
Anchoring Russia in Europe and promoting democracy and a social market economy are key interests for Europe and the USA alike .
Europe requires this support , above all , in view of Russia &apos;s situation .
Through the Partnership and Cooperation Agreement , and the NATO ##AT##-##AT## Russia Founding Act , the EU and NATO have clearly signalled their willingness to enter into partnership with Russia . Partnership also entails being able to voice opposition .
The EPP will also seek to develop the EU Common Strategy on relations with Russia which will give further strength to the PCA in areas of political , economic and trade relations and lay the basis for cooperation in the social , financial , scientific , technological and cultural fields with a goal of incrementally liberalizing trade throughout the continent .
This must be understood in the context that the EU is the major trading partner for Russia and most of the newly independent states , accounting for 40 to 50 % of their global trade .
Sharing the real challenges to both Europe and the USA outside Europe is a natural implication of a European Common Foreign , Security , and Defence Policy .
The dramatic situation in many African countries - economic and social situation , conflicts and increase of refugees and internally displaced persons , declining health services and growing threat of HIV / AIDS - concern all European countries .
The proliferation of modern military technology , especially weapons of mass destruction and delivery systems - also in unstable countries with aggressive regimes - domestic conflicts which spill across borders and trigger migration , and the links between unstable countries with aggressive regimes with terrorism and international organized crime , pose a threat to our security .
To avoid new conflicts on a global scale , a comprehensive range of cooperation and assistance from the West , along with a policy of conflict prevention , regionally and globally binding security policy agreements , arms control and disarmament , are vital . Europe &apos;s experience of living through and overcoming this phase in its history means that Europe can and should make a significant contribution to this .
Despite the ambiguities and setbacks in the global development of civilization , the European People &apos;s Party believes in the opportunity for a better world and is convinced of the need for an essential European contribution to this process . The real challenge for the EU &apos;s Common Foreign and Security Policy is to develop global policies in genuine partnership with the USA .
Geopolitics is an important instrument of political analysis . But it should not be the determining factor in international politics .
Our view of the world is based in the human person and our values .
Europe is also vulnerable to environmental destruction caused by the industrial civilization .
The answers can only be found when environmental aspects are integrated into the economy .
New technologies can also be a strong ally in reducing pollution and environmental degradation .
The EU must continue to play a leading role in the fight against climate change and must also endeavour , to that end , to obtain the ratification and implementation by the USA of the Kyoto Protocol .
We must do all we can to ensure that the EU adopts legislation on environmental responsibility which is based on the principle that the &quot; polluter pays &quot; .
Its rich culture , its political and economic potential , and its internal conflicts make this region , in the EPP &apos;s view , the greatest long ##AT##-##AT## term challenge for European policy ##AT##-##AT## making . This acquires an extra dimension through the growing presence of Islam within European societies .
Cultural dialogue with Islam is therefore essential in safeguarding peace and tolerance within the European nations , and in promoting good ##AT##-##AT## neighbourly relations with Islamic nations . More access to the European market and more assistance , above all in developing democratic and market economic structures , are further key elements in achieving this goal .
Europe ´ s history and especially its geographic location together with its global responsibilities make it incumbent for it to play a key role in the Middle East Peace Process .
This must extend beyond the provision of necessary financial resources , so that the Essen European Council &apos;s decision to confer &quot; privileged status &quot; on Israel in its relations with the European Union can become reality .
In this context , the European People &apos;s Party calls for the intensification and expansion of the Barcelona process .
Europe is a prosperous region enjoying democratic rights and fundamental freedoms and as such is an attractive target for immigration . It directly borders regions with a spiralling population growth , poverty and shortage of water , in which human rights are frequently violated .
The migration problems will never be solved if Europe does not follow an intensified policy of development cooperation , including the establishment of a free trade area with the countries of the Mediterranean , and more generally , under the conditions laid down under the MEDA Programme , access to the European market for export products from developing countries , and of promotion of democracy , good governance and the rule of law .
Member States wishing to act militarily must be able to do so in the EU &apos;s name provided that they obtain a quorum ( yet to be specified , but different from the present one ) .
All Members of the Union must act with solidarity , including financial solidarity .
We ultimately derive our strength and motivation from our values ( freedom and responsibility , dignity of the human person , solidarity , justice and the rule of law ) , which are a whole vision of life , and cannot be separated from each other .
An essential part of this freedom and responsibility is the possibility for people to live and to organise themselves in civil society according to their fundamental beliefs and convictions .
In the economy , the market is an instrument which enables people to deploy their gifts and talents on the basis of their own freedom and responsibility .
The market should be free and responsible , both in a social sense and in its approach towards the natural environment .
Civil society , the market , and the government are not ends in themselves , but ultimately serve to foster freedom , responsibility , and the dignity of the human person .
The government should not take over those tasks that can best be performed by society itself .
The subsidiarity principle must inform all decision ##AT##-##AT## making in the European Union .
Solidarity , the care of the human person for his or her neighbour , is an indispensable part of the freedom and responsibility of the person as it is of government .
Solidarity begins with the protection of those who are weakest , by civil society as well as by public institutions .
Solidarity should colour the relationships between people and their communities . Solidarity is no less relevant to relationships with people further away and with future generations .
This includes respect for the integrity of Creation . We reject concepts that consider a person as an atomised individual guided by self ##AT##-##AT## interest alone , as we also reject ideologies which think solidarity can only work through state institutions .
Europe must also deepen its common identity and solidarity in order to promote its social and economic cohesion and reduce the disparities between the levels of development of the various regions .
The European People &apos;s Party is firmly persuaded that all the regions of the EU must have the same opportunities to participate in the development of the Union .
This identity and solidarity must be extended to the candidate states .
The law is the instrument government use to promote justice . Democratic politics - free elections , open and representative dialogue - is the best way through which a just order may come about .
Genuine democracy can therefore never be incompatible with the rule of law . Accountability and integrity in political behaviour are essential safeguards .
Democracy should be as close to the concerns of the people as possible . Only where the scale of problems so requires should a task be taken to a higher level .
In many fields , European integration is an essential contribution to promote justice . Europe is not an end in itself , but is our contribution to a more peaceful and just global order .
A society of justice must provide for the safety of its citizens .
Laws must exist and be upheld to combat criminality and corruption .
But a good and safe society is first and foremost created through the upbringing of new generations which must be lead by certain principles and values .
Parents and schools share the responsibility of teaching our children about what is right and wrong and what is the meaning of democracy , solidarity and equality .
A &quot; valueless &quot; upbringing and education causes disorientation and distrust .
Society and the State have to serve the human person and the common good .
Human persons and communities must have the right to accomplish what they can by their own initiative .
What smaller scale and independent organizations cannot do has to be assigned to a greater and higher association ( region , state , supranational organization ) .
Therefore , subsidiarity is also the key principle of decentralisation , federalism , and European integration .
Every social activity is by nature subsidiary .
Politics must support the activities of human persons , families , and the intermediate society , not destroy or absorb them .
In order to allow individuals and their free associations to develop to the maximum in the social field , the States - in all possible fields - should employ the resources saved for supporting a policy aimed at strong fiscal deduction for those citizens who pay contributions to socially characterized private bodies which work in the cultural , political , scientific and charitable fields .
Society must safeguard the opportunities of coming generations .
Politics have to bear in mind sustainability not only of the environment , but also of public finance , pension schemes , and solidarity .

Many count the ability to learn from history among the political virtues , and rightly so .
But not every attempt to base political decisions on historical experience bears scrutiny .
To justify going to war against Iraq in 2003 , George W. Bush and American neoconservatives repeatedly invoked the example of Germany . They told the world that the &quot; re ##AT##-##AT## education &quot; of Germans following the defeat and occupation of Nazi Germany in 1945 shows that the transition from dictatorship to democracy is possible by means of external military force .
Is it correct to draw such a general conclusion from this particular case ? Or was it specific historical conditions that made the democratization of Germany – or , more accurately , a part of Germany – into a postwar success story ?
This is the question to which I would now like to turn .
The democratization of the part of Germany occupied in 1945 by American , British , and French troops was not the first attempt to introduce Western democracy to Germany . The revolution of 1848 aimed to create a Germany that was both a nation state and a constitutional state .
Unfortunately , the autumn of 1918 also marked the period when military defeat had become certain . The coinciding of democratization and defeat was one of the heaviest psychological burdens that the Weimar Republic would have to carry and it was one of the more deep ##AT##-##AT## seated reasons why the first German Republic foundered in the storms of world economic crisis and was replaced by a dictatorship of extreme nationalism – the so ##AT##-##AT## called &quot; Third Reich &quot; .
Traditionally , Germany belonged to the Western world .
In the High Middle Ages , Germany helped implement the most fundamental forms of power separation – the separation of spiritual and temporal power as well as the separation of princely and corporative power .
These were the two pre ##AT##-##AT## modern forms of power separation that constituted the Latin West and distinguished it from the Byzantine East .
Germany also made active , formative contributions to the two major emancipation movements of the Early Modern Period – the Reformation and the Enlightenment .
Unlike France and England , however , Germany did not develop into a nation state directly out of these movements . State ##AT##-##AT## building took place at the level of the prince ##AT##-##AT## controlled territorial states rather than at the level of the Holy Roman Empire of the German Nation , which until its dissolution in 1806 wanted to be something different and something more than a nation state .
Germany did not draw the same political consequences from the Enlightenment as France , England , and the young United States of America .
The forces that held power in Germany up until 1918 forcefully rejected the ideas of representative democracy . During the First World War , the intellectual elite polemically contrasted the &quot; ideas of 1789 &quot; with the &quot; ideas of 1914 &quot; , the latter of which held that a strong and just authoritarian state must protect Germany &apos;s inward ##AT##-##AT## looking culture , its Kultur der Innerlichkeit , from the materialistic civilization of the democratic West .
Thomas Mann &apos;s 1918 &quot; Observations of a Non ##AT##-##AT## political Man &quot; is the classic literary document of German protest against Western political culture .
Mann soon distanced himself from this view , but many of his readers still clung to it , even after the end of the monarchy and the introduction of a parliamentary system .
For all that , the Revolution of 1918 to 1919 did not spell a radical break with Germany &apos;s pre ##AT##-##AT## democratic past .
The reason for this lay mostly in the partial democratization that had already taken place in Germany long before 1918 .
Ever since Bismarck &apos;s creation of the Kaiserreich in 1871 , Germany had known a significant aspect of democracy in the form of universal male suffrage . It guaranteed German men a right to participate in legislation , even if they couldn &apos;t vote for their political leaders .
After the Kaiserreich collapsed , there was only one way to go – towards more democracy : woman &apos;s suffrage , the democratization of voting rights at the state and local levels , and the consistent implementation of a parliamentary government based on majority rule .
So as we can see , German democratization in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries was non ##AT##-##AT## simultaneous ( ungleichzeitig ) .
The parliamentarization at the end of the First World War was preceded by the earlier introduction of universal male suffrage in the formative period of the Kaiserreich .
The citizens of the first German democracy were accustomed to political participation via elections , not the accountability of their leaders to parliament .
When the last majority ##AT##-##AT## rule government of the Weimar Republic collapsed in the spring of 1930 , Germany resorted to its &quot; back ##AT##-##AT## up constitution &quot; , a semi ##AT##-##AT## authoritarian system of emergency decrees issued by the Reich President . Starting then , the Reichstag as a legislative organ had less of a say than it did during the constitutional monarchy of the Kaiserreich .
It soon became apparent that the wheel of history could not be turned back without serious consequences .
The de ##AT##-##AT## parliamentarization galvanized antiparliamentary forces on the right and left .
In the Reichstag election of 31 July 1932 , National Socialists and Communists together received the majority of votes and parliamentary seats .
The winner of the election was Hitler , who now led Germany &apos;s by far strongest political party . Since 1930 he had been presenting himself as a champion of the political rights of Germans , while at the same time appealing to the widespread resentment felt toward Western democracy , which many associated with the victors .
As a result , Hitler benefited more than any other politician from the Ungleichzeitigkeit ( the non ##AT##-##AT## simultaneous or asynchronic nature ) of Germany &apos;s democratization .
After coming to power in January 1933 , Hitler was able to win the support of Germany &apos;s educated classes by cultivating the myth of a new thousand ##AT##-##AT## year Reich .
In previous years , rightwing intellectuals from the &quot; conservative revolution &quot; had resurrected the idea of a supranational – one could even say , divinely ##AT##-##AT## ordained – German mission , whereby the Reich was to become the European Ordnungsmacht and lead the Old Continent in its fight against Western democracy and Eastern bolshevism .
In the medieval version of the legend , the Reich &apos;s duty was to stop the rule of the Antichrist ; Hitler exploited this myth just as much as its older version , where the Antichrist was a Jew .
Still today , many underestimate the extent to which the Third Reich availed itself of political theology .
The situation in 1945 was almost entirely different than that in 1918 . After the First World War came neither a societal nor an ethical break with the past .
The Kaiserreich &apos;s military leaders , high ##AT##-##AT## level bureaucrats , judges , academic teachers , industrialists , and large landowners were able to carry over their influence safely into the Weimar Republic . Although the most important documents implicating the political and military leaders of the Kaiserreich had been known since 1919 , a self ##AT##-##AT## critical examination of the Kriegsschuldfrage – the question of war guilt – did not take place .
On the contrary : in reaction to the Treaty of Versailles and its war ##AT##-##AT## guilt clause stipulated by the Allies there emerged the fanciful view that Germany bore no specific responsibility for the war .
This Kriegsunschuldlegende joined forces with another legend , the notorious Dolchstoßlegende – the claim that , by failing to adequately support the war , unpatriotic forces at home effectively stabbed fighting troops in the back , thus precipitating German defeat .
These legends were among the most powerful weapons used by rightwing Nationalists to attack the Weimar Republic .
After Germany &apos;s unconditional surrender on 8 May 1945 , such views still found an audience , but that audience represented only a small portion of the population .
For the vast majority it was evident that Nazi Germany had initiated the Second World War , and it was evident that their defeat was a result of Allied military supremacy .
The Second World War , unlike the First , ended with Allied occupation . Except for those areas under Polish or Soviet administration , the occupation encompassed all of pre ##AT##-##AT## 1938 Germany .
There were no German representatives who could speak for the entire population of the four occupation zones , there were no national parties and , most important , there was no German military .
The leadership of the Third Reich that had survived the Zusammenbruch were forced to stand trial at an Allied tribunal .
One cannot call denazification a success . For one , its implementation by the Western occupying powers was inconsistent .
Though the British and the French were more generous than the Americans , even the Americans tempered their judgment during the course of the Cold War .
In the end , the young Federal Republic of Germany reintegrated most of the former Nazis to avoid creating a reservoir for radical rightwing protest . Another problem was that many of the reforms introduced by the occupying powers did not endure .
The liberalization of the crafts code ( Handwerksordnung ) and public service law ordered by the Americans and the British , for example , was either revoked or never went into effect to begin with .
What is more , while important reforms failed , others were prevented .
The American occupying power rejected the socialization of key industries provided for by the constitution of the state of Hessen because it ran counter to the principle of free enterprise .
Of the &quot; old elites &quot; , only one group was eliminated completely : the aristocratic estate owners east of the Elbe , a group who after 1918 had stood in almost unanimous opposition to the first German democracy and did much to bring about its downfall .
The large landholdings east of the Oder ##AT##-##AT## Neisse line fell to Poland ; those of northern East Prussia went to the Soviet Union .
Any estates in the Soviet occupation zone were appropriated during the 1945 land &quot; reform &quot; , the majority of which were then transferred to expelled farmers from Polish or Soviet administered areas in the East .
For its part , the Western occupation zones had nothing comparable with the Junker estates east of the Elbe . The land reform and the loss of the eastern territories created a deep caesura in Germany &apos;s social history .
The powerful elite who had , for centuries , made their mark on Germany literally had the ground cut from under them .
The expulsion of the Germans from the eastern provinces of the German Reich as well as from Czechoslovakia and Hungary cannot be simply characterized as an instance of Soviet or Stalinist methods .
It is true that the systematic removal of Germans was a logical consequence of Stalin &apos;s plan to annex northern East Prussia and shift the territory of Poland toward the West ; but it must also be remembered that the United States and Great Britain had given their general consent to this radical solution at the Yalta Conference in February 1945 .
In internal talks , Roosevelt and Churchill based their position on a historical precedent : the exchange of minorities between Greece and Turkey stipulated by the January 1923 Treaty of Lausanne .
In the Potsdam Agreement of August 1945 , the Soviet Union , the USA , and Britain jointly agreed that the transfer of Germans to Germany should &quot; be effected in an orderly and humane manner . &quot; Yet the presence of this &quot; saving clause &quot; had no mitigating effect .
By August 1945 , millions of Germans had already fled , or had been forced , into the four occupation zones , and those not yet displaced were afforded no effective protection by the Potsdam Agreement .
The expulsion of Germans in 1945 and after amounted to an Allied ##AT##-##AT## sanctioned form of ethnic cleansing .
Its deeper cause lay of course in Germany : it was Adolf Hitler &apos;s Third Reich – its policies of exploitation and oppression , deportation and genocide – that destroyed the basis for peaceful coexistence among Germans and non ##AT##-##AT## Germans in eastern central Europe .
The Potsdam Agreement sounded clear ##AT##-##AT## cut about the political future of occupied Germany , but it wasn &apos;t .
The occupation was supposed to eliminate German militarism and Nazism and &quot; to prepare for the eventual reconstruction of German political life on a democratic basis and for eventual peaceful cooperation in international life by Germany &quot; .
Yet the problem was that the Western powers and the Soviet Union held opposing views on democracy .
As the Hamburg constitutional jurist Hans ##AT##-##AT## Peter Ipsen put it in 1949 , &quot; Cuius occupatio , eius constitutio &quot; , or , &quot; he who occupies , his constitution .
&quot; Ipsen &apos;s formulation – a modern take on the policy of &quot; cuius regio , eius religio &quot; famously proclaimed in the 1555 Peace of Augsburg – concisely captures the difference in development between Western and Soviet occupation zones . The Potsdam Agreement tried to give the impression of an Allied consensus , yet in reality such a consensus did not exist .
Liberation from Nazi dictatorship did not translate immediately into freedom . This applied to divided Europe in general and divided Germany in particular .
The success of the Western Allies and the American policy of democratization in Germany had many causes .
The military defeat and occupation of Germany allowed for a break in continuity more fundamental than the one in 1918 . The establishment of a democracy in West Germany was also facilitated by the absence of a Junker class .
West German society had a stronger bourgeois tradition than society east of the Elbe .
At least as important in establishing democracy in West Germany was the change of consciousness among the German people .
In October 1945 the temporary council of the German Protestant Church published what is now known as the Stuttgart Declaration of Guilt .
One of its key sentences reads : &quot; By us infinite wrong was brought over many peoples and countries .
&quot; German Protestantism , particularly German Lutheranism , had done much in the past to help solidify the authoritarian state . In 1945 it showed us another Lutheran tradition : the willingness to confess one &apos;s own guilt .
The Stuttgart Declaration encountered widespread resistance , from former Hitler sympathizers as well as from within the Church .
The declaration was criticized by many for appearing to endorse the Allied doctrine of German collective guilt . In retrospect , however , this document marked the beginning of a long and paradoxical process of rethinking .
To borrow a term from the philosopher Hermann Lübbe , a &quot; communicative silence &quot; dominated Germany in the 1950s . People didn &apos;t speak about what they did during the Nazi period ; and they said as little as possible about what their neighbours did .
In 1960 , a new generation emerged and treatment of the past became increasingly self ##AT##-##AT## critical . Though it confessed German guilt , the Stuttgart Declaration did not specifically mention the extermination of the Jews .
Not until after the Historikerstreit – the 1986 controversy about the uniqueness of the Nazi genocide – did the view of the Holocaust as the central event in twentieth ##AT##-##AT## century German history become widely accepted .
The Allied attempt to democratize Germany would hardly have been successful had there not been a German attempt three decades earlier .
Bonn did not become Weimar because it had the chance to learn from Weimar .
The Western Allies found in Germany an important , albeit small , &quot; back ##AT##-##AT## up army &quot; of politicians who had experienced the Weimar Republic and learned from its mistakes .
The first Federal President , Theodor Heuss , belonged to that group , as did the first Federal Chancellor , Konrad Adenauer , and the first postwar leader of German social democracy , Kurt Schumacher .
Joining the democrats who had remained during the war were returning emigrants likewise shaped by the first German Republic .
When the Bonn Parliamentary Council drafted the Basic Law for the Federal Republic of Germany in 1948 and 1949 , they made sure to avoid the systematic shortcomings of the Weimar Constitution of 1919 .
The result was a functional representative democracy that took on its opponents with foresighted and effective constitutional parameters .
Never again should a democratically ##AT##-##AT## elected head of state become an ersatz ##AT##-##AT## legislator who deactivates the parliament . Never again should a parliament topple the head of government without having to elect his successor .
Never again should enemies of democracy legally seize power . It required the experience of the first democracy and its downfall to inoculate the second against such crises .
Had the Germans not learned from their own history , the Western Allied &quot; reeducation &quot; would have failed .
While West Germany cultivated &quot; anti ##AT##-##AT## totalitarian &quot; principles in reaction to its recent past , the Soviet occupation zone , later to become the German Democratic Republic , had to limit itself to &quot; anti ##AT##-##AT## fascist &quot; tenets .
The &quot; anti ##AT##-##AT## fascist &quot; position served to legitimate a new dictatorship mainly modelled on the Soviet Union .
The GDR didn &apos;t receive democratic legitimation until much later when , as a result of the &quot; peaceful revolution &quot; in the fall of 1989 , it received its first and last freely ##AT##-##AT## elected parliament on 18 March 1990 .
The People &apos;s Chamber used its newly won freedom to pass a resolution approving the GDR &apos;s merger with the Federal Republic of Germany .
Hence , even after 1945 the process of German democratization remained non ##AT##-##AT## simultaneous .
Germans who lived in the West experienced a second attempt at democracy in the municipal and state elections of 1946 and 1947 .
For the Germans in Soviet ##AT##-##AT## controlled territory , the local elections of 1946 were the last elections with any degree of freedom . The East Germans did not enjoy a secure democracy until four and a half decades later .
It should not be forgotten that the oft ##AT##-##AT## invoked West German &quot; success story &quot; also owed much to the longest sustained period of economic growth in the twentieth century , a boom that began in the early 1950s and lasted until the middle of the 1960s .
In ironic allusion to the Weimar Republic , the economic historian Knut Borchardt named the German &quot; economic wonder &quot; the &quot; back ##AT##-##AT## up constitution &quot; of the second German democracy .
High rates of growth allowed the swift integration of expellees from the former Eastern provinces and refugees from the GDR ; they eased the balancing of social and confessional antagonisms ; they were essential in reducing membership of radical parties on both sides of the political spectrum ; and they contributed to the transformation of the two major democratic parties – first the Christian Democrats and later the Social Democrats – from sectional parties to people &apos;s parties .
Without the economic boom , Adenauer would have had much greater difficulty in garnering majority support for his policy of Western integration .
The same can be said for the intensely debated issue of rearmament . As prosperity increased in West Germany , so did the need for security .
With regard to external security , this need could only be met through close alliance with Western powers .
The joint opposition to communism and the Soviet Union formed a bridge between West Germany and the Western victors .
The more the West accepted the Federal Republic of Germany as a political partner , the weaker traditional German reservations about Western democracy became .
It helped the Federal Republic &apos;s military integration into the West and the consolidation of Western Europe that a conservative democrat like Adenauer was their champion ; and it helped Adenauer that he didn &apos;t have to defend his foreign policy to a radical right , but to a moderate left led by the Social Democrats .
The largest opposition party at the time placed more emphasis on the reunification of Germany than on the Federal Republic &apos;s integration into the West .
German politics had , from the perspective of the Weimar Republic , reversed themselves .
In the first German democracy the right was nationalist and the left was internationalist ; in Bonn the moderate right supported supranational politics while the moderate left earned themselves a patriotic image .
The Social Democrats came to power only after they accepted the political reality of the alliance with the West . The Ostpolitik introduced by Willy Brandt , the first Social Democratic Federal Chancellor , supplemented , rather than neutralized , Adenauer &apos;s Westpolitik .
The policies of the social ##AT##-##AT## liberal coalition government between 1969 and 1982 aimed to expand the Federal Republic &apos;s options in the East and make the reality of a divided Germany more bearable .
Reunification remained an official goal of the Federal Republic , yet it was seen as unobtainable by most of its citizens and politicians so long as the East ##AT##-##AT## West opposition continued . Consequently , the Federal Republic no longer saw itself as something provisional .
In contrast to its early years the Federal Republic &apos;s self ##AT##-##AT## image was , as the historian and political scientist Karl Dietrich Bracher wrote in 1976 , increasingly that of a &quot; post ##AT##-##AT## national democracy among nation states &quot; .
By the 1980s , Western integration had ceased to be a bone of contention between political parties in the Federal Republic .
Indeed , one witnessed the emergence of something like a posthumous Adenauer Left , whose intellectual spokesman was the philosopher Jürgen Habermas .
The unreserved opening of the Federal Republic to the political culture of the West is the major intellectual accomplishment of the postwar era , of which my generation in particular can be proud .
The only patriotism that doesn &apos;t alienate us from the West is a constitutional patriotism .
Those who want to restore a conventional form of German national identity destroy the only reliable foundation for our integration into the West .
Four years later , the event took place that no one in the 1980s thought possible : after negotiations between the Federal Republic and the GDR as well as with the four former occupying forces , Germany was reunified . The third of October 1990 meant nothing less than the solution to the postwar German question .
The Two Plus Four Treaty – the legal basis of the unified Germany – determined the new Federal Republic &apos;s borders , with the Oder ##AT##-##AT## Neisse line stipulated in the Potsdam Agreement being a necessary requirement for reunification .
In respect to European security , the Two Plus Four Treaty sanctioned Germany &apos;s membership in Nato . Put differently : the Soviets accepted a solution to the German question on Western terms .
There is also a larger historical context in which 3 October 1990 must be seen . The German question of the nineteenth century concerned the relationship between unity and freedom .
Reunification brought with it that which the liberals and democrats had been constantly striving towards but had reached neither with the Revolution of 1848 nor with the Reichsgründung of 1871 : unity in freedom .
By way of conclusion , I would like to return to the question with which I began : Does the successful postwar democratization of Germany ( or , more accurately , a part of Germany ) allow us to draw the general conclusion that a country can be brought from dictatorship to democracy by means of external military force ?
Or should Germany &apos;s success be attributed to particular historical factors ? My answer , which emerges from the material here , is as follows .
Though the Germany of 1945 needed Allied liberation , West Germany was able to make the transition from liberation to freedom only because it could fall back on and re ##AT##-##AT## establish its own liberal , constitutional , and democratic traditions .
Culturally , Germany was a country of the Old Occident , connected with Western democracies through common legal traditions based on the rule of law . Germany became a nation state later than France and England and a democracy later still , but the liberal forces of the nineteenth century did much to help the authoritarian state on its way to becoming a constitutional one .
Bismarck &apos;s empire was a constitutional monarchy with all the characteristics of a constitutional state , including a parliament of democratically ##AT##-##AT## elected representatives .
The Weimar Republic – Germany &apos;s first political system based on majority ##AT##-##AT## rule – failed not least because it was widely considered to be a form of government imposed on Germany by the victors . But the Parliamentary Council in Bonn learned its lessons from the shortcomings of the Weimar Constitution : the Basic Law ( Grundgesetz ) it passed in 1949 laid the constitutional foundation for the Federal Republic &apos;s success .
The young democracy of Weimar – whose voters ultimately elected parties calling for the abolishment of democracy – taught Germans that there is more to democracy than majoritarianism .
Democracy also relies on a political culture of peaceful dialogue .
Along with differences of opinion , this means , according to the political scientist Ernst Fraenkel , establishing a basic consensus on values and institutions that are held to be worth defending .
It is for this reason that the Parliamentary Council declared the essential provisions of the Basic Law inalienable .
If there is something to be learned from German democratization for the democratization of Iraq or other states then it is this : the decisive impulses must come from within .
The only improvements sustainable in the long ##AT##-##AT## run are those that find support in a country &apos;s own past experiences .
Reforms seen as imposed entirely from without will be undone sooner or later . There is nothing that stands more in the way of an opening to the political culture of the West than nationalist or religious resentment .
There is nothing more conducive to such an opening than the development of a pluralistic civil society .
Successful democratization is based on societal and cultural requirements that cannot be brought about through external force . Those who want to help other countries with democratization can at most help those countries help themselves .
Those who appeal to historical analogies often exploit history so that it reflects their own wishful thinking .
By invoking the German example of 1945 to justify taking out Saddam , the proponents of the war in Iraq did just that .
Without further reflection , they argued that what worked for a Western country with a tradition of constitutional government and a developed parliamentary culture would also work for a non ##AT##-##AT## Western country that does not know , or only barely knows , those traditions . The members of the neoconservative &quot; warring party &quot; .
the Kriegspartei so to speak , could pursue this line of argument only because they refused to acknowledge the historical facts that spoke against their undertaking . Q.E.D.

Warning : devfs is obsolete and has been removed from the stable 2.6 tree in the 2.6.13 release .
Users on 2.6 kernels are hereby advised to switch to udev .
For further information on udev , please refer to the Gentoo udev Guide .
Traditional Linux implementations provide their users with an abstract device path , called / dev .
Inside this path the user finds device nodes , special files that represent devices inside their system .
For instance , / dev / hda represents the first IDE device in their system .
By providing device files to the users , they can create programs that interact with hardware as if the hardware was a regular file instead of using special APIs .
The device files are split in two groups , called character devices and block devices .
The first group consists of hardware of which read / writes are not buffered .
The second group naturally consists of hardware of which read / writes are buffered .
Both devices can be read one character at a time , or in blocks .
Therefore , the naming might sound confusing and in fact is wrong .
In the previous example we see that / dev / hda is a block device .
However , more importantly , it has two special numbers assigned to it : 3 , 0 .
It is used by the kernel to map a device file to a real device .
The major corresponds with a certain device , the minor with a subdevice .
The first device file corresponds with the fourth partition on the first IDE device .
In other words , the minor corresponds with the partition where the major corresponds with the device .
The second example has 4 , 5 as major ##AT##-##AT## minor pair .
In this case , the major corresponds with the terminal driver , while the minor corresponds with the terminal number ( in this case , the fifth terminal ) .
If you do a quick check in such a / dev , you &apos;ll find out that not only all your devices are listed , but all possible devices that you can imagine .
In other words , you have device files for devices you don &apos;t have .
Managing such a device group is cumbersome to say the least .
Imagine having to change the permissions of all device files that have a corresponding device in your system , and leaving the rest of the device files as they are .
When you add new hardware to your system , and this hardware didn &apos;t have a device file previously , you would have to create one .
Advanced users know that this task can be accomplished with . / MAKEDEV inside the / dev tree , but do you immediately know what device you have to create ?
When you have programs interacting with hardware using the device files , you can &apos;t have the root partition mounted read only , while there is no further need to have it mounted read ##AT##-##AT## write .
And you can &apos;t have / dev on a seperate partition , since mount needs / dev to mount partitions .
As you can imagine , the kernel hackers have found quite a number of solutions to the aforementioned problems .
However , many of them had other flaws as described in http : / / www.atnf.csiro.au / people / rgooch / linux / docs / devfs.html # faq ##AT##-##AT## why .
We are not going to talk about these implementations , but focus on the one implementation that did make it to the official kernel sources : devfs .
It only provides the user with existing devices , adds new nodes when new devices are found , and makes it possible to mount the root filesystem read only .
And it tackles more problems we haven &apos;t discussed previously because they are less interesting for users ...
For instance , with devfs , you don &apos;t have to worry about major / minor pairs .
It is still supported ( for backwards compatibility ) , but isn &apos;t needed .
Yet devfs does come with it &apos;s own problems ; for the end users these issues aren &apos;t really visible , but for the kernel maintainers the problems are big enough to mark devfs obsolete in favor of udev , which Gentoo supports and uses by default on most architectures since the 2005.0 release when using a 2.6 kernel .
For more information as to why devfs is marked obsolete , please read the udev FAQ and udev versus devfs document .
One of the first things you might notice is that devfs uses directories to group devices together .
This improves readability , as now all related devices are inside a common directory .
For instance , all IDE ##AT##-##AT## related devices are inside the / dev / ide / device directory , and SCSI ##AT##-##AT## related devices are inside / dev / scsi / .
SCSI and IDE disks are seen in the same way , meaning they both have the same subdirectory structure .
IDE and SCSI disks are controlled by an adapter ( on ##AT##-##AT## board or a seperate card ) , called the host .
Every adapter can have several channels . A channel is called a bus .
On each channel , you can have several IDs .
Such an ID identifies a disk . This ID is called the target .
Some SCSI devices can have multiple luns ( Logical Unit Numbers ) , for instance devices that handle multiple media simultaneously ( hi ##AT##-##AT## end tapedrives ) .
You mostly have only a single lun , lun0 / .
So , whereas / dev / hda4 was used previously , we now have / dev / ide / host0 / bus0 / target0 / lun0 / part4 .
This is far more easy ... no , don &apos;t argue with me ... it is easier ... ah whatever !
Note : You can also use more Unix ##AT##-##AT## like device file naming for hard disks , such as c0b0t0u0p2 .
Using this new scheme sounds fun , but several tools and programs make use of the previous , old scheme .
To make sure no system is broken , devfsd is created .
This daemon creates symlinks with the old names , pointing to the new device files .
With devfsd , you can also set the permissions , create new device files , define actions etc .
All this is described in the next chapter .
When you alter the / etc / devfsd.conf file , and you want the changes to be forced onto the system , you don &apos;t have to reboot .
SIGHUP will have devfsd reread the configuration file , reload the shared objects and generate the REGISTER events for each leaf node in the device tree .
SIGUSR1 will do the same , but won &apos;t generate REGISTER events .
Warning : Currently , Gentoo cannot live without the compatibility symlinks .
# Comment the following two lines out to remove the symlinks REGISTER .
You need to reboot your system for the changes to take affect .
When you load a module , devfs will automatically create the device files .
Important : These instructions are valid as long as pam ##UNDERSCORE## console is disabled in / etc / pam.d / system ##AT##-##AT## auth .
If you enabled pam ##UNDERSCORE## console there , then PAM has the final word on permissions .
You shouldn &apos;t be using pam ##UNDERSCORE## console anyway , as it has been removed from Portage .
The second field is the device group , starting from / dev .
It is a regular expression , meaning you can select several device files in one rule .
The fourth field is the ownership of the device file , and the fifth field contains the permissions of the device file .
This is the default behaviour for Gentoo : if you chown ( CHange OWNer ) and chmod ( CHange MODe ) some device files , devfsd will save the information so that it will persist across reboots .
In other words , changed device files are copied over to / lib / dev ##AT##-##AT## state as soon as the change happens , and are copied over to / dev when booting the system .
Another possibility is to mount / lib / dev ##AT##-##AT## state on / dev at boot ##AT##-##AT## time .
To do this , you must make sure that devfs is not mounted automatically ( meaning you &apos;ll have to recompile your kernel ) and that / dev / console exists .
The devfsd.conf manpage explains the syntax of the / etc / devfsd.conf file .
The devfs FAQ explains everything about devfs .
It also contains information about the internal devfs structure and how drivers can support devfs .
On LinuxJournal there is an interesting article on devfs for Management and Administration .
Daniel Robbins has written a set of articles for IBM &apos;s DeveloperWorks about Advanced filesystems .

( Own report ) - Right up to the putsch , Honduran President , Manuel Zelaya &apos;s liberalist opponents were being supported by forces close to the German Free Democratic Party ( FDP ) . Zelaya &apos;s rival and current presidential candidate , Elvin Santos , is among them , as well as Roberto Micheletti .
Micheletti took over the office of president following Zelaya &apos;s kidnapping , last weekend . During the course of his presidency , Zelaya , who , just a few years ago , had himself been supported by the FDP affiliated Friedrich Naumann Foundation , turned his back on the German organization &apos;s neo ##AT##-##AT## liberal policy .
He turned instead toward the ALBA international alliance ( &quot; Alternative Bolivariana para las Américas &quot; or Bolivarian Alternative for the Americas ) formed around Venezuela , Bolivia and Cuba . This has led to hefty power struggles inside his party .
His opponents , who up until two weeks ago were being advised by an FDP affiliated strategist , have close ties to the Naumann Foundation . The putsch resolved the conflict to the advantage of the partners in the Naumann Foundation .
( Own report ) - Hungarian rightwing extremists are preparing a resolution to the European Parliament to revise the Beneš Decrees and are demanding German parliamentarians to support them in this effort .
The resolution is initiated by a member of the Jobbik Party , who was recently elected to the European Parliament .
The Jobbik Party has won 15 Percent of the votes in Hungary . Numerous German politicians support this demand to annul the Beneš Decrees because Hungary and Germany share common ethnic political concepts legitimizing claims against neighboring countries .
For years , Budapest has invoked the ethnic &quot; right of blood &quot; ( &quot; ius sanguinis &quot; ) , adapted by Germany , co ##AT##-##AT## opting Slovak and Rumanian citizens ( &quot; Hungarians abroad &quot; ) , thereby escalating international tensions .
Since the economic crisis began , rightwing extremists have enhanced their electoral successes in Hungary by accentuating ethnic chauvinist policy .
According to recent opinion polls , nearly half of the Hungarian population approve of the fact that their country will also be represented in Brussels by three rightwing extremists .
Their organizations are appealing to Berlin , to support their ethnic radicalization .
( Own report ) - In spite of explicit warnings , German organizations are trying to escalate the internal power struggles in Iran . The state ##AT##-##AT## financed Deutsche Welle radio station is one of the foreign broadcasters , whose Farsi ##AT##-##AT## language program is firing the protesters on , with hourly reports on reactions from the west .
Party ##AT##-##AT## affiliated foundations , including the German Free Democratic Party ( FDP ) -affiliated Friedrich Naumann Foundation are offering their partnership to those opposing the central structures of Iran &apos;s government .
After initial hesitations , the German Foreign Ministry has also begun to openly intervene in the domestic affairs of a fellow UN member nation , making &quot; demands &quot; on the government of a sovereign country .
Over the weekend , the chancellery also assumed the position of a challenging partisan in the Iranian domestic power struggles . German press organs are indulging in blood ##AT##-##AT## lecherous anticipation of the &quot; chaos in Teheran .
&quot; Every intervention in the current power struggles is &quot; highly detrimental , &quot; assessed Bahman Nirumand an expert on Iran . It makes the protest demonstrators appear to be &quot; guided by the West , their leaders will be branded as collaborators .
&quot; Indeed , the current support for the Iranian opposition is essentially motivated by foreign policy objectives . As long as the West had its Shah regime in power in Teheran , the Iranian movement for democracy was repressed , in a bloodbath , with western help .
( Own report ) - The German foreign intelligence service is predicting shifts in the global power constellation and is demanding &quot; a geo ##AT##-##AT## strategic debate in Germany .
&quot; According to a classified Federal Intelligence Service ( BND ) study , the collapse of the western national economies , whose recuperation is unpredictable , could lead to a drastic acceleration of China &apos;s rise and the decline of West Germany &apos;s long ##AT##-##AT## term primary ally , the United States .
This intelligence service paper is being currently discussed in Berlin and excepts have been leaked to the press to prepare public opinion for possible changes in global policy orientation .
&quot; A long ##AT##-##AT## term global crisis &quot; cannot , for the moment , be excluded , assesses the BND , who , if this happens , is anticipating &quot; massive unemployment and movements of migration in unprecedented dimensions &quot; as well as an escalation of nationalism and very serious international tensions .
An essential question , for the future global conflict constellations , according to this paper , will be if Russia can be bound to the West or if Moscow will go over to the Chinese adversary .
( Own report ) - Western politicians are using martial announcements to prepare another escalation in the war in Afghanistan .
&quot; More victims on all sides &quot; can be expected over the next few weeks at the Hindu Kush , declared NATO &apos;s General Secretary . Western combat units are currently being substantially increased .
AWACS planes are being sent to optimize flight activity in the combat area . Tomorrow , Wednesday , the German cabinet will approve German participation on these planes .
Last May the number of aerial attacks , infamous for their high number of civilian casualties , reached a new record high .
According to reports , insurgents have even taken control of the German area of operations in the vicinity of Kunduz and are openly challenging the German occupation troops .
Since May , serious battles have been reported . In view of the extension of combat to Pakistan , military experts are referring to a &quot; Southwest Asian warzone &quot; and explicitly drawing parallels to the Vietnam War .
( Own report ) - Today &apos;s reception of Zimbabwean Prime Minister , Morgan Tsvangirai , is an element of the German government &apos;s participation in the western campaign to overthrow the Zimbabwean president .
Since the 90s , Tsvangirai has been groomed by the West , particularly Germany , as the head of the opposition to drive President Mugabe from power . Berlin is accusing Mugabe of presenting himself as an &quot; adversary of the western liberal order .
&quot; His removal has been on the German foreign policy agenda for the past ten years .
With Tsvangirai , after a long struggle , being named prime minister , second to his rival , Mugabe , in a transition government , last February , Berlin and Washington see new opportunities for driving Mugabe from office .
Tsvangirai is currently visiting North America and Europe to reach the necessary agreements .
Germany wants to support him through development aid financing , sent to Zimbabwe by way of NGOs , strengthening the position of Tsvangirai ’ s followers .
( Own report ) - Berlin is intensifying its pressure to obtain access to Turkmenistan &apos;s natural gas deposits .
Following the conclusion of a basic agreement guaranteeing the RWE Corp. , with headquarters in Essen , Germany , access to the Turkmen gas deposits , the German Ministry of Economics and various German companies have intensified over the past few weeks their negotiations with Ashgabat .
The objective is to obtain a privileged position for German companies helping Turkmenistan to develop its economy .
Not only is this aimed at Germany becoming the recipient for a major portion of Turkmen raw materials , but also at strengthening German influence in the country . Germany &apos;s chances are good .
A German company drew up the master plan for Turkmenistan &apos;s economic development . In addition , over the past few years , German companies have been able to make themselves a name , by accomplishing quite unusual services for the dictatorship in Ashgabat .
Human rights organizations raise strong criticism of the state , whose natural gas is to reduce Germany &apos;s dependence on Russian resources .
( Own report ) - Just a few days before the European elections , German government advisors published recommendations for countering reprehensible parties in East and Southeast Europe .
In those EU countries &quot; a strong dissatisfaction &quot; with the social development has taken root since the 1989 / 90 transformations , writes the German Institute for International and Security Affairs ( SWP ) .
Certain forces have repeatedly been successful in consolidating the anger at the dramatic impoverishment and the social decline , transforming this into popular votes for parties in opposition to the &quot; establishment &quot; loyal to the EU .
When they use confrontational and strictly oppositional agitation against the ruling elites , they must be classified as &quot; populist &quot; regardless of their orientation otherwise .
Among these &quot; populist &quot; parties are several that have been predicted to make a good showing in the upcoming European elections .
The SWP suggests that isolation as well as integration would be means to be considered for their neutralization .
But the foreign subsidiaries of German party affiliated foundations will play an important role in setting up loyal party structures .
( Own report ) - The US president &apos;s brief visit to Germany is being overshadowed by a long ##AT##-##AT## term shift in the balance of power in trans ##AT##-##AT## Atlantic relations .
The bankruptcy of the US automobile giant , General Motors ( GM ) , and Berlin &apos;s success in forcing it to relinquish its European subsidiaries ( Opel , Vauxhall ) to a Germany ##AT##-##AT## linked consortium , has led to great losses in the US automobile industry .
Getting Moscow involved in the new Opel management and the automobile producer &apos;s planned re ##AT##-##AT## orientation toward markets in the former Soviet Union are strengthening the German ##AT##-##AT## Russian special alliance and adding new weight to the breakdown of the nearly 80 years of the German ##AT##-##AT## American corporate alliance .
This process corresponds to the constant deterioration in German ##AT##-##AT## American trade relations , while trade between Germany and Eastern Europe , particularly with Russia is steadily growing .
The shift in power is being accompanied by a rise of German significance in Europe .
The dismantling of Opel &apos;s production capacity is mainly affecting plants located outside of Germany .
( Own report ) - With millions in government &quot; development aid &quot; financing , German textile and commercial companies are forging a purchasers &apos; cartel for African cotton in competition with their US rivals .
They seek to take control of several hundreds of thousands of West and South African cotton producers , who will have to commit themselves to produce cotton exclusively in accordance with specific guidelines established by the cartel .

What measures do you usually use to protect your data ?
The main window with the information about the disk .
The overall general state of its health is shown together with the percentage of the remaining life and performance rate .
If you have several hard drives , you can switch among them using the tabs at the top of the window .
This sample screenshot shows the situation when the state of health is not good and the life of the disk is in danger .
In this case , we recommend that you keep HDDlife ® constantly running in the background mode and monitoring the state of the disk automatically at least once every half an hour .
And you must not forget to back up your data regularly .
In this screenshot you can see an example of how HDDlife ® works if it detects that the life and the health of a disk is at the critical level .
It is recommended that you back up all your data immediately and to replace your hard drive as soon as possible .
In the system tray , the program displays the temperature of your hard drive and an indicator of its health and life state - the lower it is , the worse it is .
If you enable the mode with regular preventative checks of the health and life of your disks , the results will be displayed right after each check in this manner .
This message will disappear in 15 seconds in order not to interfere with your other work .
You can disable displaying the temperature of your hard drives and enable displaying the health and life state for each disk in a separate icon .
Or , you can leave only the main HDDlife ® icon in the system tray . If you have several hard drives , the tooltip shown when you hover the mouse pointer over the icon will show only the first two disks - this is a limitation of Windows .
The icon representing their health is displayed directly on the icons of the hard drives in all programs on your computer - from the My Computer window with the list of drives and to the &quot; Open File &quot; dialog box of any program - Word , Notepad , etc .
You will never forget about the health of your hard drives and about the safety of your data !

It sounds like the band is trying to do an imitation of coldplay doing an imitation of U2 . The musical soul feels like its been watered down to the point to where there is no edge left ( Get it ?
Excuse my passive aggressiveness : Your playing is solid , the production shines , but I &apos;ve heard your songs in an non ##AT##-##AT## condensed soup form .
I managed to get to the start of track 5 before I couldn &apos;t take anymore . I then went straight to track 7 because a reviewer said they liked it , but unfortunately it was more of the same , or worse because of the &quot; wall of sound &quot; guitar effect .
Somehow I endured until the end , but no part of it appealed at all , and track 10 ended the misery on a really whiny note . Ouch .
I &apos;m sure that this style of music has its fans , but I &apos;m afraid I &apos;m not one . This album gets classified firmly under &quot; more non ##AT##-##AT## memorable pop &quot; for me , and I could have been more critical .
No spirit , no surprise , zero character . The songs , despite their unique melodies , have the same treatment and ultimately all sound like individual parts to one giant song .
I love the ambiance of the album , sounds like coldplay with a harder edge . Lyrics are thought ##AT##-##AT## provoking and reflect isolated situations in real life .

Little Slovenia is this year the first of the countries that joined the EU in 2004 to take over the EU Presidency .
Reason enough for a short winter visit to sample the Mediterranean feeling in the capital , Ljubljana .
The city has a lively , youthful flair .
That the name Ljubljana comes from “ ljubljena ” ( loved ) is something one would be happy believe .
“ But the most wonderful thing about Ljubljana is that you only needs to drive one hour to Trieste for an excellent Italian cappuccino &quot; , says Maja Vardjan , an architect in her mid ##AT##-##AT## thirties , a journalist who for just over half a year has been the head of a gallery for design in Ljubljana .
With just 280,000 inhabitants Ljubljana ( called in German Laibach ) is small , in the culture scene everybody knows everybody else .
“ You need to get away every so often to prevent a feeling of claustrophobia developing ” , says Maja critically , but the self ##AT##-##AT## confident Slovene doesn &apos;t allow the comparison with the nearby Austrian provincial capital of Graz , which is about the same size : “ Ljubljana is , after all , a capital city . We can choose between dozens of clubs with international music programmes , just as many serious galleries , alternative culture centres , between hundreds of bars and cafés , any number of museums and theatres .
We are a ‘ capital village ” . Incidentally , Maja admits that she likes to drive to Vienna , which is about four hours away by car , to visit the many international exhibitions there that art institutions in Ljubljana cannot afford , due to the enormous insurance costs alone .
The artist and director of the inter ##AT##-##AT## media platform “ intima.org ” , Igor Stromajer , sees Ljubljana as belonging to a global trend : “ In contrast to the larger cities like Paris and London , where no one can any longer afford a life worth living , the smaller regional cities are on the way up ” . You only have to take a look at Lille or Porto , or indeed Maribor in Slovenia , which has an extremely lively art scene .
At dinner in the evening Igor Stromajer tells me : “ Slovenia is so small and our coast is so short that when we go swimming we have to keep with our passports clenched between our teeth ” . Slovenes , according to Igor , have always had problems in finding an identity of their own , due to the country &apos;s geographical position as a transit land and , above all , to its size .
“ In fact there is nothing that is specifically Slovene : no typical foods , no special landscape , no individual architectural style .
The sun is shining , the high peaks of the Alps glitter with snow and are reminiscent of Merano or Bolzano , and the sky suggests the proximity of the 46.6 kilometre long Slovene Riviera .
You think you can smell the sea .
But this is probably your imagination .
But the outdoor terraces – filled to bursting – of the innumerable cafés and bars that spread a Mediterranean atmosphere through the small picturesque streets of the old town do not seem to be an illusion .
Since August 2007 smoking has been strictly forbidden at the workplace , in public buildings and in bars and restaurants .
) outside , under the warmth given off by gas lanterns , where apparently they are joined by a number of non ##AT##-##AT## smokers as well , out of solidarity .
And what do Slovenes think about being described as “ Balkan ” ?
Alenka Greorgič , the young artistic director of the legendary Gallery Škuc asks this question herself : “ Where do the Balkans begin ?
For a Swede in Vienna , for us Slovenes naturally on the Croatian border .
Many of us prefer to define our country as part of the Adriatic ##AT##-##AT## Alpine region .
We have quite a few jokes on this theme , which is a living expression of our current search for identity .
But certainly there is a little of the Balkans in us , after all we were part of the Socialist Republic of Yugoslavia and a lot of Bosnians and Croats live in this country .
During the Yugoslav period Slovenia always defined itself strongly in terms of culture .
Therefore the state supported almost everything , even clubs , even individual creative artists , indirectly through paying their social security contributions .
Today roughly between 2,500 and 3,000 persons are registered in Slovenia as “ culture workers ” ; around half of them receive support .
The institutions are allotted budgets for a three ##AT##-##AT## year period by an expert commission but the programme must be applied for in advance each year .
Maja showed me a street lamp in a side street with two strange drooping phallic symbols , one of the many small interventions in urban space that are examples of the strange humour of the brilliant city architect Jože Plečnik ( 1872 – 1957 ) .
German architecture theorist Andreas Ruby is said to have once described the lamp as a “ column of double impotence .
The function of a small Plečnik pyramid at the side of the pavement in Zoisova Street still puzzles the inhabitants of Ljubljana today .
Motorists have to dodge around this bulky monument ( as was intended perhaps ? ) .
Is this a possible indication that Plečnik was a Freemason ?
“ For us young Slovene architects the way in which Plečnik was able to shape public space in Ljubljana is highly influential .
He was – also in private – a rather odd character whose spirit still shapes the city today .
A master of his profession and something of a trademark for Ljubljana ” , says Slovene architect Matija Bevk ( ##STAR## 1972 ) who with his partner Vasa Perović ##STAR## ( 1966 ) has set up one of the many young architects offices in the city .
“ The young architecture scene in Ljubljana is extremely lively ” , explains Maja Vardjan .
“ In the 1990s the competitions were still not restricted and so a few young smaller offices were able to establish themselves with large projects early on . ” The legendary exhibitions “ Sixpack ” ( 2004 ) and “ Young Blood – I &apos;m a Young ‘ Slovene ’ Architect ” ( 2005 ) did the rest of what was needed to make the young generation of Slovene architects known throughout the world .
There is a lot to be built in Slovenia and the money to build it is available .
Slovenia has only slightly more than two million inhabitants , is regarded as the “ swot ” among the new members countries of the EU , and this year has the “ honour ” of being the first of the new members to take over the EU Presidency .
The economic figures could not be better , even though in January of this year there was almost a general strike , as the low earning population was no longer willing to accept the inflation that resulted from the introduction of the euro .
The average monthly wage is around one thousand euro ; but the prices in H &amp; M and Benetton are as high as in Vienna .
But the state functions , in contrast to the situation in Bosnia or Bulgaria , which is probably one of the reasons that young artists stay here .
With his business partner the young architect Matija Bevk has leased , at a reasonable rent , a generously sized floor in an old tobacco factory .
The tobacco factory in which Bevk and Perović have set up their practice is one of the empty industrial complexes outside the centre of the city which are at present being converted for the country &apos;s “ creative industry ” , or to make office spaces or elegant apartments .
But perhaps this kind of attitude has a somewhat different meaning in Ljubljana than in the West . In the Eighties , when Slovenia was still part of Yugoslavia , in the period between the death of Tito in 1980 and the “ Ten Days War ” , which in 1991 ultimately led to the independence of the country , when the system was starting to fall apart the culture scene in Ljubljana was more vibrant than ever before .
Art actions that were critical of the state , wild punk concerts , zany lesbian and gay meetings shaped the nature of the underground scene in the Slovene capital .
The protagonists of the artists collective from those days are still active as artists today .
At that time the NSK ( Neue Slowenische Kunst / New Slovene Art ) from which the industrial band “ Laibach ” was to emerge was a major source of impulses .

Scene from the first act of Parisina , by Gaetano Previati .
For weeks now the Italian musical world has been waiting for the premiere of Mascagni &apos;s latest opera with the greatest eagerness .
One must realize that Italy doesn &apos;t only see in Mascagni the creator of &quot; Cavalleria Rusticana &quot; , but also holds in high esteem the composer of &quot; Iris &quot; , and particularly of the romantic opera &quot; Isabeau &quot; , which since its successful premiere two years ago has remained in the repertoire of Italian opera houses .
Moreover , interest for the new work has grown due to the fact that none other than Gabriele D &apos;Annunzio has undertaken to provide the libretto to his brother in arms .
But for those who haven &apos;t yet been drawn by the attraction of those two names , the publicity made by young dynamic publisher Lorenzo Sonzogno should be an indication of the significance of the event .
Here one can see in the windows of music stores atmospheric representations of the main scenes of &quot; Parisina &quot; painted by the master hand of Gaetano Previati , strange mystic among the painters of Italy who , living and working in the middle of the big city , has created a peculiar art of the dream .
1 There the general attention is directed to a life ##AT##-##AT## sized poster by Plinio Nomellini made in the divisionist manner , which represents a scene from the third act , Parisina reading at the light of a lantern 2 .
And then there are the newspaper articles about the great preparations for the performance .
The strong choirs of the Theater of La Scala had to be made 100 voices stronger .
The orchestra had to obtain new instruments , like bass clarinets and bass flutes .
And finally consider the ticket prices for the first performance : 100 lire for orchestra seats , 20 lires even for the back seats of the upper gallery , and 10 lire for standing tickets .
The curiosity was therefore at its summit a few days before the representation .
The libretto could really not possibly contain any surprise .
D &apos;Annunzio has chosen his subject from the Middle Ages chronicle of Ferrara , which tells of the criminal passion which Ugo of Este , the natural son of count Nicolò , conceived for his stepmother Parisina Malatesta .
Florentine novelists Bandello and Casca had , one century after the facts , entertained their contemporaries with a representation of the events with an erotic spirit .
Lord Byron understood the deep tragic of the story of the unfortunate lovers and dedicated them an epic poem .
Antonio Somma was celebrated for his play &quot; Parisina &quot; from 1834 ( almost contemporaneous with Donizetti &apos;s opera , which provided music to the laments of the beautiful countess ) but , like the opera , it made no lasting impression .
Now how has D &apos;Annunzio worked with the original material , which was for the most part already digested ?
The following synopsis tries to answer this question and at the same time tries to show that the poet has indeed created a gripping drama .
The first act takes place in a magnificent villa on an island on the Po near Ferrara .
Ugo exercises at arbalest shooting , while the women and maids from the court of the count work and sing .
Ugo &apos;s arrows keep missing the target , and he believes that his weapon is cursed .
Aldobrandino tries to calm down his excited friend .
But Ugo confesses to him his inner unrest and his yearning for adventure and fighting .
Ugo &apos;s mother Stella interrupts the dialog of the two youths and laments to her son about her sorrow .
She hates Parisina with the relentless hatred of a defeated rival , and forces Ugo to take revenge on her .
Ugo explains that he is prepared for the task and obtains from his mother a small bottle containing a slow ##AT##-##AT## acting poison , which he must give to the young wife of his father .
At this point she appears and is violently insulted by Stella .
Crying , Parisina stands the underserved insult , but demands satisfaction for the shame inflicted upon her to her husband , meanwhile returned from the hunt .
Ugo becomes furious , as countess Parisina speaks against his mother words of utter contempt .
His father reprimands him , but Ugo doesn &apos;t wants to know anything about a reconciliation with the enemy of his mother . He declares that he prefers to leave the court .
We find Parisina and her servant , La Verde , in front of the holy house of Loreto .
Her husband has answered her wish of making a pilgrimage there , and asked Ugo to accompany her , with the hope of bringing their souls closer .
The long stay together during the trip and in Loreto has indeed brought them together and awakened sinful love in their young hearts .
That love , so far held back with difficulty , is allowed to erupt as Ugo gets wounded when fighting the pirates who want to steal the miraculous picture of the Madonna of the holy place , and Parisina bandages him .
Once again Parisina resists and kneels down with Ugo at the foot of the statue of the immaculate virgin , and prays to be saved from threatening sin .
But love doesn &apos;t know any respect even in front of the mother of God , and the two praying lovers are overwhelmed by ardent passion and fall in each other &apos;s arms .
A long kiss seals the love of Ugo and Parisina ...
One year passes between the second and third acts , during which the two lovers , undiscovered , can enjoy their love .
She is tormented by the fear of being discovered and a presentiment of misfortune .
She must think of Francesca , who was killed by her ancestor from the house of the Malatesta in anger over her unfaithfulness .
But the arrival of Ugo chases away those bad thoughts .
From the garden , the sweet song of the nightingale enters the chamber .
At that moment La Verde enters with grave steps and announces the visit of count Nicolò .
The scared Ugo hides behind the curtains of the bed .
The burning torches of the lord of Ferrara illuminate the terrifying encounter between the husband and the wife .
Nicolò draws his sword and wants to strike the robber of his conjugal honor .
But Parisina screams and warns him not to kill his own son .
Full of hatred and rage , Nicolò grabs Ugo by his hair .
She has bewitched the young man with spells and love potions , which have robbed him of his senses .
Ugo swears that it is not true .
She has made him drunk with the divine dream of love , nothing else .
Calmly , Nicolò speaks his judgement over the two lovers .
Both heads will fall on the same execution block , under the same ax .
Again they kneel down like a year earlier and call each other tenderly by their names ...
In the last act , in the darkness of the Tower of the Lion of the castle of Ferrara , Parisina and Ugo await their execution .
They do not repent of their love and , ecstatic , praise the happiness they have enjoyed .
Stella , the mother of Ugo , approaches sadly and wants to embrace her beloved son a last time .
But the two lovers do not hear her voice , until she screams and inveighs at the shameless seducer , who won &apos;t even allow her to give her son the ultimate kiss .
Parisina soon frees Ugo and reminds him to access to his mother &apos;s wish .
But he will not let himself be separated from her loved one until the last moment .
With a scream of despair , the unfortunate mother turns away .
Parisina looks once more in the eyes of her loved one , then covers his head , consecrated by death , in a black cloth .
The executioner appears , and Parisina and Ugo kneel down in front of the execution block .
And so , united in death , they wait for the executioner &apos;s glittering ax .
A short , passionate and moving prelude introduces the opera .
When the curtain is raised , the stage reveals a picture of splendidly colored costumes from the Middle Ages .
The eyes are fully satisfied , but the ear is strangely touched by the melancholy complaint of La Verde , who depicts the pains and torments of love , a really fitting prelude to this drama of unhappy love .
However the powerful introduction of the chorus , which praises the joys of love , soon chases away the initial melancholy .
The melody of these songs by the chorus is fresh and original , the interweaving of the voices is elaborate , and the end of the piece , constructed in the manner of a fugue , caused the first warm applause .
In the scenes between Ugo and Aldobrandino , as well as between Ugo and his mother , the parlando predominates , while the orchestra depicts the psychology of the characters on stage with lively colors .
We also hear various motives , one of the hatred of Stella , another of the presentment of death , and a third one of love , which in the course of the evening will keep reappearing , when Mascagni wants to remember these moments .
But he does not expand these motifs to melodies like Richard Wagner .
In comparison with his earlier operas , Mascagni &apos;s orchestra has gained in diversity and expression .
It no longer restricts itself to the excessive prominence of the violins ( the &quot; violinate &quot; , as the Italians call them ) , but he works with all the means of the art of modern instrumentation , without however being able to surprise with original sound colors .
Often the orchestral effects are of exaggerated realism , and the themes are put together in colorful mosaics , rather than organically merged .
The appearance of Parisina is announced by a tender orchestral prelude , which introduces for the first time the motif of the unhappy lady of Ferrara .
Mascagni finds strong dramatic accents for this scene between the two rivals , which is interrupted effectively by the joyous hunt song .
The song with which Ugo answers his father abounds with youthful power .
Here the Mascagni of the old manner comes to mind .
Then the chorus of the happy love resounds behind the scene and in the orchestra the cello sadly sobs of yearning passion .
The second act is composed of two parts .
In the first one the lyric element rules in the action and in the music , then the battle between the pirates and the men of Ugo starts and leads to the passionate second half of the act .
Soft church songs open the act and produce an atmosphere of peaceful tranquility , which is found also in the dialog between Parisina and La Verde .
The song with which Parisina consecrates all her jewelry and her clothes of glittering splendor to the holy virgin is sweet and affectionate .
On the other hand one would have wished that the portrayal of the battle taking place behind the scene had been more alive .
In the scene between the two lovers , the music gains life and strength .
A simple , touching melody repeats continually until the orchestra picks it up and powerfully expands it to a culminant song of the endless love ...
Gloomy , menacing chords introduce the third act .
For the first time , the theme of the ghostly Francesca da Rimini ( a couple of passionate moving measures mostly entrusted to the brass instruments ) appears .
The nightingale song , coming from the garden illuminated with moonlight , appears too long to me and because of this generates more impatience than required to introduce the sweet love scene .
The orchestra then tries to move the listener using all its means when Ugo enters and the languishing Parisina embraces him .
The fight of the instruments gets wilder and wilder , more and more passionate , until Nicolò deals with his wife and brings silence .
First the search for the hidden lover drives the music to a fast tempo again .
The lament of the father , who invokes the Savior who let him go through such misfortune , is quite moving .
The short last act presents fairly monotonous dialogs between the two lovers . The plea of the mother to her son is not of much greater effect .
Mascagni was right to decide to drop this last act completely , starting with the second representation of the opera . This shortens the opera from a duration of five hours to four hours and fifteen minutes .
The verdict of the audience on Mascagni &apos;s latest work was decidedly favorable .
Each act was followed with warm applause , and the Maestro had to appear repeatedly .
This is definitely a significant work , which shows us a new side of Mascagni as a composer of a drama in music of stronger effect .
While not everything is constantly successful in this opera , we have to acknowledge that the long ( much too long ) score doesn &apos;t lack its share of treasures .
With the respect owed to the genius of a great musical artist , we must recognize that Mascagni has understood how to provide D &apos;Annunzio &apos;s powerful tragedy with appropriate music .
If Mascagni hasn &apos;t yet reached the ultimate or the highest , we want to rejoice of what he has created and we hope that a new work will bring him the great success that we are hoping for .
The performance of &quot; Parisina &quot; was exemplary in every respect .
Ms. Poli ##AT##-##AT## Randaccio was a powerful ambassador of the title role and her acting was on the same level .
Young Spanish tenor Ippolito Lazzaro simply did a amazing job as Ugo .
Baritone Galeffi as Nicolò and Ms. Luisa Garibaldi as Stella were worthy of completing the ensemble .
The famous choirs of La Scala honored their reputation and the orchestra , conducted by Mascagni himself , was excellent .
In addition the theater provided magnificent sets , and all those elements worked together to guarantee full success to Mascagni &apos;s latest work .

One very special celebrity guest at the Cardion ab Grand Prix Ceske republiky last weekend was Formula 1 star David Coulthard .
Taking in the action from round twelve at Brno on Sunday was long ##AT##-##AT## time MotoGP fan David Coulthard , the experienced Formula 1 driver , who is due to retire from racing at the end of this year .
With more time on his hands as of 2009 it would be no surprise to see the 37 year ##AT##-##AT## old star paying more visits to the MotoGP paddock , given his admiration for the sport .
Coulthard explained , &apos; Before I started on four wheels I was doing a little bit of motocross but I was breaking too many bones !
I got into karting and then progressed to cars but I have always had a love of bikes and I am always amazed at what these guys are able to do on two wheels .
Comparing the MotoGP environment to that of his own sport , the Scottish driver who boasts 13 F1 wins and 62 podiums , noted , &apos; It is a lot more open than our paddock . If we try to imagine that in F1 we imagine that it wouldn ´ t work , but clearly it does work here .
Detailing how his affinity for the MotoGP World Championship had grown over the years , courtesy of his friendship with a certain five ##AT##-##AT## time premier class title winner , Coulthard added , &apos; For many years I was training with Mick Doohan before he retired .
Steady improvements for Italian in Phillip Island as he looks to correct Kawasaki front end feeling deficit .
Marco Melandri ´ s difficulties from 2008 have changed with a switch in bike , with the lack of rear feeling that he experienced with the Ducati Desmosedici GP8 mimicked by the front end of the Kawasaki Ninja ZX ##AT##-##AT## RR .
Luckily for the Italian , persistence in &apos; Team Green ´ s three ##AT##-##AT## day test at Phillip Island has already seen him reduce his race time from this year ´ s Australian race , despite rain on the second day of testing .
Melandri worked overnight with his crew and Kawasaki ´ s suspension engineers in order to find some improvement on the front , with reasonable success coming as a result .
Aiming for times in the low 1 ´ 31s , the former MotoGP World Championship runner ##AT##-##AT## up clocked a quickest lap of 1 ´ 31.8 before rain and wind cut the day ´ s activities short .
A small setback for Melandri occurred late on with a small crash at turn four , leaving his machine in need of a rebuild before the final day of testing &apos; Down Under ´ .
Whilst teammate John Hopkins focused on tyre evaluation work for Bridgestone , Melandri got his hands on the new chassis previously debuted by Olivier Jacque on Wednesday .
Jacque himself improved his time from the opening day , recording a 1 ´ 32.1 lap , but noted that progress was not coming as fast as expected .
&apos; We ´ ve not really improved our lap time as much as we would have liked , but we have tried many different set ##AT##-##AT## up changes , with a focus on the chassis geometry .
The wind was also a big problem today as it was very strong and changed direction from morning to afternoon , ´ said the Kawasaki test rider on Thursday .
All three riders will be back on track on Friday for a final day of action , with data being sent to Japan for evaluation over the winter .

Gotti &apos;s got Murder Inc . We &apos;re both still together — there &apos;s no separation . We &apos;re both together doing what we do , but I got my own situation and I got new artists .
&quot; He is still signed with Murder Inc. and I will make a decision shortly on what I am gonna do with him , &quot; Gotti responded in a statement he sent to MTV News . &quot; His last record didn &apos;t sell well at all .
And , once again , he had his CREATIVE freedom to do whatever he wanted to do . But for some reason the people did not respond to the album or to him .
That deal quickly got quashed by Gotti and company , and whatever fence that was broken between the two seemed to have been mended . Lloyd even appeared on the first season of Irv &apos;s TV show &quot; Gotti &apos;s Way &quot; while prepping his album Lessons in Love .
We &apos;ve all been waiting for this track to leak but we were hoping it wouldn &apos;t leak until The Inc had its future sorted out , I wont go on a rant about this but let &apos;s just say we here at MIO are not too happy about this and have been sitting on the mp3 for about two months now waiting for the go ahead to give it to you the fans .
Anyway enjoy Hollywood below and leave your opinions on our forum .
First we bring you the future of Murder Inc with a new single from Blok Gang &apos;s now we have for you a new track from a Murder Inc vet in Blackchild . Blackchild took a bit of time off recording music but is back in the booth and working on new material .

Pontresina wants to take an active part in the development of nordic fitness sports and offers officially signposted nordic walking trails , concentrated in the Pontresina Bernina Nordic Park .
The Pontresina Bernina Nordic Park is an accumulation of signposted routes , along already existing hiking trails .
They are round ##AT##-##AT## courses , so the start and finish are at the same point , and are divided into categories according to how strenuous they are ; blue , red and black .
These routes are signposted the same over the whole of Switzerland .
A large information board can be found at the swimming ##AT##-##AT## bath and the cross ##AT##-##AT## country skiing centre with tickets and information to height variations and the trails themselves .
From the indoor swimming pool , cross the village centre to get to the Tais concert square ( 1,819m ) , where concerts are on all the time , if not by the local orchestra then by some birds .
Right before the idyllic square , turn left to pass through picturesque forests of larch and pine stone trees above the Surovas train station and Resgia to get to the Runtunas pasture ( 1,845m ) .
( To shorten your trip , follow the return ##AT##-##AT## trail signs at this point .
) Through areas full of woods and plants , the trail leads to the turning ##AT##-##AT## point opposite the Montebello gravel pit ( 1,869m ) .
Get back to Pontresina crossing open space with a view of Piz Albris , the home of Switzerland  s largest colony of ibeces .
Setting off from the indoor swimming pool , cross the village centre to get to the Tais concert square ( 1,819m ) .

The Albanian expression for the customary law of the Albanians is Kanun .
This word was taken over out of Sumerian ( gi , Rohr ) over Acadian ( qanu , Rohr ) to the Hebrew ( qane , Rohr ) and from there to the Greek ( kanna , Rohr ) and to canons , where it was trained further and meant &quot; rule , standard &quot; .
The main meaning of the Kanun on Albanian , is the customary law .
The sources of the customary law of the Albanians are : Kanuni i Skënderbeut , Kanuni i Malsisë së Madhe , Kanuni i Labërisë , Kanuni i Lekë Dukagjinit ( KLD ) .
In this work , I will treat the most well ##AT##-##AT## known customary law of the Albanians and / or the criminal law in the Kanun of Lekë Dukagjini ( KLD ) .
The admission of the KLD in written form from verbal excessive quantity was taken by the Franciscan Shtjefën Gjegjovi of Kosova .
He began to publish the right statutes collected by him in the year 1913 in the magazine of the Albanian Franciscan &quot; Hylli i Dritës &quot; .
After its murder by Serbs on 14.10.1929 , other Franciscans systematized the left material and published it under the name &quot; Kanuni i Lekë Dukagjinit &quot; .
The customary law &quot; Kanuni &quot; was divided in 1263 § § and into twelve books .
The Kanun regulated both civil and criminal questions .
This Codex was at the same time the actual Albanian condition for many centuries up to the Second World War .
The penal jurisdiction of the Kanun was a mixture from more public and self law .
The natural person alone was legally responsible after this customary law .
With respect to the person one differentiated between this and their accessories .
The impact was a consequence of anger , a battle of words or a threat . Fights between the adults on the one hand and the children on the other hand , were treated differently .
A fight , which happened between two adults , and if from it blood flowed , rather as honoring injury as bodily injury was considered .
If the bodily injury were not so large , it was understood that the person who got hurt of the body could pay back in the same way . The fight in the public as well as that fight , which arrived at ears of the public , produced a rising hate .
The fight between children was not taken seriously .
Even if the child were struck by a man from the relationship , it was presupposed that it had happened as a &quot; punishment &quot; .
By mutilating one understands a separating or the injury of any part of the body .
In the Kanun a wound under peace , which was caused by the weapon , fell .
The Albanian customary law did not make a large distinction between intentional and unintentional mutilating .
Unintentional mutilating was measured with more indulgence .
The reason for this indistinct distinction lay probably in the fact that the possibility should be taken to the author of being able to state to its defense that the act happened negligently for his part , even if it added deliberately the wound .
Intentional were the cases if someone directed deliberately the weapon against another and wounded it .
On the other hand under unintentional ( negligent ) mutilating , one understood those by coincidence and without intention added wound .
This occurred then , e.g. if someone wanted to meet the enemy however an indifferent one meets .
Independently of it , whether one added intentionally or unintentionally a wound to someone by the weapon , the wounded one had the right to revenge himself according to the principle &quot; wound for wound &quot; .
Around the blood revenge under the Albanian trunks of &quot; own &apos; category &apos; of the blood revenge historiography developed , in which Austrian and German travelers and scientists were particularly active .
The blood revenge was presented to the readers as something sensational .
&quot; Depending upon the author , they aroused the impression that the life of the Albanians was only concerned around blood revenge .
I do not share the same opinion .
The nature of the blood revenge existed therein that one had the right to revenge for the death of own blood relatives .
According to the Kanun , one differentiated between retaliation ( hakmarrja ) and blood revenge ( gjakmarrja ) .
The retaliation came to the course , if someone were damaged by stealing at the fortune .
The damaged one had the right for its stolen fortune , a retaliation to exercise after the maxim &quot; stealing for stealing &quot; .
The blood revenge was a consequence of the earlier committed murders or injuries of the honor .
The author , supported by the rules of the Kanun , was that one , which killed with own hand ( § 848 ) .
Other involved one in a murder and / or a blood revenge was the aid / accomplice ( § 831 ) , the accomplice ( § 766 ) .
A certain group of persons were preserved by the blood revenge , like women , children , the priest , old and ill humans as well as spirit patients .
The homicide without intention was not pursued .
The author had to remain however hidden , for a long time , as it is called in the Kanun , &quot; the blood is hot &quot; ( the excitation lasted ) and the case was well examined and clarified ( § 933ff ) .
Now the mediators ( so ##AT##-##AT## called &quot; reasonable people &quot; ) occurred , in order to confirm that really the homicide was unintentional .
If the mediators stated that the homicide was without intention , the author had to pay only a blood penalty ( § 934 ) .
After an execution of the blood revenge the author ( dorasi ) had to inform even the public and the family of the victim that he practiced blood revenge .
In the case of a death or blood revenge , it was forbidden exercising massacre by the author to the victim .
If someone added further wounds with a measurer after the death at the body of the victim , the author was charged with double murder , i.e. he had to be pulled for responsibility not only for a murder , but for two .
The woman remained exempted from blood revenge .
Against them , none was allowed to exercise blood revenge .
If no male person were in the house , and who has not yet carried out revenge , the woman had to revenge .
She could be killed only in the case of adultery , otherwise killing a woman - it was intentional or unintentional - was a large dishonor .
Even the weapons , by which a wound or a death of a woman was caused , were considered as &quot; worthlessly &quot; ( unworthily ) to be used for war purposes .
If the author without authorization ( for someone else ) exercised blood revenge , his house was burned and down ##AT##-##AT## cleverly , the entire mobile fortune , as for instance furniture , grain , cattle was confiscated .
He had to leave the dwelling and its master areas with the whole family and pay a penalty .
The mediator ( ndermjetsi ) is called that one , which interfered , in order of the &quot; bad words to decide &quot; ( për me da fjalët e kqia ) i.e. the risen tension as consequence of the disputes to turn gossip away , which could lead to the revenge , from the homicide and other spoiling development ( § 667 ) .
Mediator could be man and woman ( very rarely and only into small things ) , also the priest ( § 669 ) .
In order to decide on an evil , the priest interfered not in the own name , but in the name of the parish or the trunk ( § 675 ) .
The experienced men were mostly mediators .
The murder could switching with any friend after committed an act around the relatives ( family ) of the killing , to ask for granting some sucked , and to be able to receive &quot; days off &quot; ( vow ) around the peace vow for some days .
During the period of vow , no revenge could be exercised .
The vow was extremely rarely granted to that person , who implemented the murder .
The God peace ( besa ) was in the Kanun one period of the liberty and the security , which granted the house of the killing to the author and his family members , in order to pursue it not immediately and a certain period ago for the blood .
One regarded the grant of a peace vow , as obligation of the maleness ( § 854ff ) .
The Kanun knew two kinds of the peace vow : 24 hours and 30 days .
The vow of 24 hours occurred , if the house of the killing granted peace vow to the author , then this ( the author ) participated at the dead celebration , although he had killed , and was charged for the kill .
This peace vow did not last longer than 24 hours .
The village could arrange an expiration of these 24 h. peace vow period over for the author and its house members an extract of a further vow of 30 days .
If the house of the killing did not grant the village peace for the family of the author , the author with its house members had to remain enclosed , it stepped a kind of house arrest , house prison .
During the &quot; weapon peace vow &quot; reached by the mediator in a controversy , it was forbade the revenge exercising .
However if the promised killed the enemy before the period of the armistice ran off , then revenge for the hurt vow was incumbent on to take to the vow receiver ( i.e. the mediator ) .
Those , which went to parents and cousins of the killing , on behalf of the author and his house , the God peace attained , called one peace bringer ( bestari ) .
They were not considered as protectors of the author and his house , thus an evil could not happen within the peace vow ( § 851ff ) .
Another kind of the switching in the Kanun was the switching of the blood ( dorzanët e gjakut ) .
A mediator of the blood was that one , which himself endeavored in the house of the killing , he reconciled with the author .
The mediator ( several can be ) , was looked for and / or selected by the house of the author ( § 972ff ) .
2. by money to the house of the killing .
The house of the killing selected the deviancy guarantees for the money of the blood .
The citizen of the blood ( dorzani i gjakut ) was the mediator , who intervened , in order to prevent each &quot; renewal of hate and fire &quot; ( § 974ff ) .
The oldest ones and the outstanding and reasonable men of the place determined the period for the payment of the money for the blood .
The determined time fixed for payment for the blood could not be extended , neither changed .
This happens , if the author himself with his house and the house of the killing reconciled .
The involved ones soaked mutually their blood .
Into two small glasses filled with liquor ( Raki ) or water ; One of the friends ( ndonjë prej dashamirësh ) tied the small finger for the author and &quot; master of the blood &quot; , and punctured it with a needle and let a blood drop to fall individually into the glasses .
After mixture of the blood they exchanged the glasses and it was enough for them also to over ##AT##-##AT## cross their hands , so that everyone drank the blood of the other one .
With &quot; 1000 joy calls ( congratulations , congratulations ) they shot off with the cans &quot; and became from enemies to brothers , as it meant in the Kanun : &quot; new brothers of the same father , the same mother &quot; ( § 988 ) .
By the property of the soul mainly the honor was understood .
After Albanian customary law one bore rather death as the injury of the honor .
These kinds of the honor injuries were so heavy that they were to be washed off only with blood .
For this injury of the goods of the soul there was neither grace still another possibility , whereby they could be settled with fine .
But if it was noticed that a woman was raped , the rapist was pursued and punished .
Sooner or later , the rapist had to penance for his act &quot; with his own blood &quot; .
However if adultery was stated that the sexual intercourse happened with agreement of the wife , then both paid for with own blood .
If someone let himself in however with an engaged girl , then the family of the author stood in blood revenge with the family of the bridegroom .
The honor of the woman was a property ##AT##-##AT## part of the honor of the man .
If he was dishonored , this was the heaviest injury of the honor of a man .
An injury of the honor by weapon robbery was in two different kinds : publicly or secretly .
Public weapon robbery happened if one had to deliver the weapon with force or obligation .
The secret weapon robbery on the other hand could be made according to a kind of thief on the nighttime or day .
It is interesting that the public weapon robbery for the robbing was a dishonor .
For the robbing the public weapon robbery was immediately also a shame .
For this reason , it was not allowed to let the larger disgrace appear in the public , as log as he with blood &quot; the greatest dishonor &quot; had to whip out himself .
The sanction for the secret weapon robbery was moderated .
One could forgive the thief a tax however he had for it to carry out in the height as for a murder .
Honoring injuries could not be paid off by contributions of equipment .
For the robbed honor there was no penalty .
It could be replaced not by articles , but only by pouring the blood or by noble assigning after the switching of the friend of heart ( § 597 600 ) .
A further distinction in the question of the honor devide the customary law of the Albanians between personal honor ( ndera vetjake , § 593 to 601 ) and public honor ( ndera shoqnore , § 602 ##AT##-##AT## 639 ) .
The Kanun of the Albanian mountains did not differentiate humans from humans ( § 593 ) .
For the injury of the personal honor the Kanun said : &quot; whom you want , forgive him ; if you like , then ( or ) wash the clouded forehead &quot; ( § 595 ) , i.e. revenge .
After § 596 everyone had its own honor for himself , and nobody could interfere .
There was a kind of the discrimination prohibition between the men .
The life of the good one and the bad one had the same value : &quot; the Kanun took ( considered ) both for ( as ) men &quot; ( § 594 ) .
Supported by these two regulations , as well as by the rule in § 887 , those means : &quot; the price of human lives is alike for the good one as for the bad ones &quot; , is to be taken as a kind of equal treatment principle , which however was applied only between men .
The robbed personal honor could not be restored by penalty , but only with blood ( death ) or assigning ( Ndera e marrun nuk shpërblehet me gja , por a me të derdhun të gjakut , a me të falun fisnikërisht .
The public honor covers the question of the guest in the house , hospitality and house right .
By patent right it was understood protecting a guest ( mikut ) .
One differentiated between injury of hospitality and the house right .
X comes into the house of Y.
As long as X remained in the house of Y , Y was obligated for the security of X. If it happened something to Y in the house of the X , then X was obliged to revenge for him , because the act of violence at Y was considered as an injury of the house right .
This case has to be understood , as injury of hospitality against someone : if Y was one of the authors , and he went in the house of X , he was allowed in no case to suffer damage from X , until he ( Y ) went to another house , because this meant an injury of the hospitality principle .
In accordance with Kanun under robbery , the acquisition of the property was understand over a strange case by open force ( § book 768. h as well as § 777ff .
The thief was after Kanun that one , &quot; that with own hand stolen the stranger &quot; ( § 768 ) .
The robbery by open force was understood as injury of the honor .
As participants at a theft in accordance with Kanun were the thief ( cubi ) , the aid ( simahorët ) , that house , where the thieves of the stealing eat , or got bread .
Aid or accomplice was also , who hid the stolen property ( &quot; the thief and aid are both guiltily &quot; , § 768 book .
If someone helped , which was not in the blood revenge , he fell in the blood revenge ( § 831 ) .
The sanction for a stolen property at fortunes was arranged after principle &quot; two for one &quot; .
&quot; Two for unity &quot; became both for cattle and for flock or for the stolen article .
If a thief stole a cow , the owner had the right to take it back , where always it was found , also when someone the stolen cow bought .
If the salesman ( the thief ) were seized , he had to pay to the owner the value of two cows for the stolen cow , and / or which owners compensate according to the principle &quot; two for unity &quot; , and the thief had to return the whole paid sum to the buyer .
A form of the complicity in the Kanun was the accomplice .
Accomplice was that one , who helped someone by criminal interference and commit a crime from behind ( § 766 ) .
The punishment for such assistance and acceptation of stolen goods was different .
When helping during a woman kidnapping , it fell in the blood and had to pay to the village a penalty at a value of 100 groshs ; it fell also with a murder in the blood and had to pay to the village 500 groshs , as well as each burglary and each property , which were stolen in the village , he had to paid for after the Kanun , &quot; as soon as it became recognized ( discovered ) &quot; ( § 767 ) .
The customary law of the Albanians does not edge a court in the sense of the today &apos;s courts .
As a court , it was considered the advice of the oldest ones ( Kanuni i pleqnis ) .
The oldest ones were either chiefs of the brother shank ( të parët e vllaznive ) or the heads of the kinships ( Krenët e fiseve ) .
Without their participation each decision or action applied as invalid ( § 993 ) .
To the oldest ones were included also the men , which were admit for their intelligence , and experience in jurisdiction questions the Council of Elders had .
The Council of Elders - also mentioned judges of the people - were mostly completely usual humans , who differed neither by origin nor social layer or otherwise from the others .
They became &quot; people &apos;s judges &quot; only by their special gift to understand circumstances fast and to interpret them as judges , honorably and plausibly after the rules of Kanun .
The Albanian customary law knew two kinds of the Councils of Elders .
For the small Council of Elders ( § 999 ) the senior of the village was taken , after brother shank and kinships , which decided for less large disputes .
Serious affairs , which hurt the honor of the village and trunk , were judged by the village elders and master heads ( § 1003 ) .
In order to be able to fall a judgment , the oldest ones and heads of the trunk the oldest ones and over ##AT##-##AT## oldest of the village were referred , in which the suspicious one lived ( § 1004 ) .
If an old resolution concerned a whole village or a trunk , the individual people judges ( oldest ones ) did not have the right to take the thing into the hand .
In such cases ( circumstances ) , &quot; the legal oldest ones of the village or trunk considered &quot; ( decided ) ( § 1009 ) .
Under advice of the oldest ones all fell , i.e. even if it concerned outstanding families , or master chieftains ( § 1014 ) .
Also the Elders , which exercised their work as judges , had rights and obligations after the Kanun .
In accordance with § 996 the Elders had the right , each threat and each controversy to simple , each from homicide adult claim , the mark by quality , other time by force , in community with the village , even when very serious threats ( the order ) could support it , the men of the trunk demand , around &quot; the outer edge and to bring the case to a reason &quot; .
Furthermore , if someone did not want to add himself to the impartial verdict , the oldest ones could meet the whole village .
If a verdict pleases , and it repented the controversy parties that they had handed , the oldest one who became out of the pledge for subjecting , could not change this verdict ( § 1001 ) .
The obligation of the oldest ones was the impartiality , and they could not be affected by gossip ( § 1015 ) .
If it happened that these obligations of the oldest ones were hurt by any of them , he was never more selected as honorees to the oldest one .
Before one began with the process , the oldest ones had an oath that they would not judge with underhandedly and party manners , and the fact that they will not rotate the rules of Kanun ( abuses ) , but a fair judgement after best knowledge and certain to fall .
In the customary law of the Albanians the regulation applied for &quot; oldest ones over the oldest one , judgement over judgement , oath over oath , were not given &quot; . Due to this regulation , is to be closed that the Kanun knew only one instance of the jurisdiction .
An appointment against the judgements of the oldest ones was followed only in exceptional cases ; it could not be raised on the part of the parties .
Only in addition of the owners of the distrainer were entitled , if they stated that an unfair judgement was pleased .
The oldest ones returned not the distrainer , but were obligated , like it were called &quot; to clean ##AT##-##AT## wash himself &quot; , i.e. in that they hands the distrainer to the selected oldest ones lay , and thus the judgement of the second oldest ones became pleases ( § 1038ff ) .
If a decision of the heads and oldest ones did not please the people , or it found , they had wrongly decided , the people had the right to not follow ( respect ) it .
In such a case , the heads and oldest one had to advise the case again , to treat it again .
The Albanian customary law in the legal proceedings after Kanun knew the following evidence : Confession , the word of honor , the secret prosecutor ( këpucari ) , ( that person , who indicates someone debt , was as for instance a secret theft or murder ) , the oath , the oath aid , the witnesses , the trace ##AT##-##AT## track ( § 769 ) , the citizens of the village , as well as surprising at the scene ( inflagranti ) .
In accordance with § 13 of the Kanun , under punishment was understood that an evil was imposed by the legal force for making one debt .
The kinds of the punishment into the Albanian customary law were : Death sentence , discharging from the trunk with members and possession , the burning of the house , the breaking and letting of the soil or cutting off fruit trees , the penalty with living cattle , the penalty by money , and the guilty one ( the author ) was explained by the trunk for bird free ( expel , proclaimed , me e leçitë = out clips ) .
Burning alive of a woman , a widow or girls , who showed themselves as violated .
The history of the German criminal jurisdiction contains some common elements with the Albanian customary law in addition , very large differences .
While the German criminal jurisdiction developed from customary law to the positive right , which is Albanian customary law , today still , remained alive in north Albania parallel with the Albanian positive right ( as for instance the blood revenge ) .
The revenge and feud , which similarities with those rules in the Kanun , were present also in the Germanic time .
The sense of the revenge and feud was after Germanic view &quot; humiliating the opponent and its kinship &quot; .
The blood revenge was in German history on 16th Century .
With the God peace movement of 11th Century , known as church movement , one has tried a pacification of certain persons to limit things , places as well as times with certain actions in relation to feud in order by the national peace to be replaced later .
The Albanian customary law did not know the Inquisition &apos;s process .
And body ##AT##-##AT## met , kinds of mutilating detention as in the German criminal jurisdiction and torture do not occur , because they would not be compatible with honour of the adults men .
While the Catholic Church in German criminal law history in the Middle Ages played a role , the Albanian customary law made a separation between Kanun and church .
In accordance with § 3 the church is not subordinate to the Kanun but its church court .
For this reason the master court could not do it any read imposes .
For misdemeanors of the priest , the Kanun said , raises the municipality complaint to the church ##AT##-##AT## upper , with the bishop ( § 3 exp .
By the kinds of the death penalty in German punishing history such as slopes , beheading , buried alive , drowning , burning , wheels , simmering in water or oil , the Albanian customary law only knew burning .
The mutilating punishments , which we know from German criminal law history , as for instance knocking the hand , knocking off individual fingers or finger limbs , knocking off a foot , cutting or peeling of the tongue , did not came in the Kanun forwards .
If we retrace Albanian history , we will state that the Albanian area was very closely with all peoples , who played a role on the Balkans , is spoiled .
Beginning with the time of the Gaul , Romans , Goths , the immigration of the Slaves in Illyria , the Macedonian empire , the Byzantine Kingdom , as well as Normans , Venice , Serbs , Ottoman realm , Austrian Hungarian realm , Italy , who successively on the Albanian areas prevailed , the Albanian people , the descendants of the Illyrians , could not lead continuously a national independent existence .
After 24 years resistance of the Albanians under guidance of Gjergj Katrioti against the Ottoman realm , the Albanian became a part of areas of the Ottoman realm from the Middle Ages to 20 Century .
The customary law of the Albanians was always auxiliary and at the same time a competitive right to the national right , to that of the Turks , that of the Albanian state after 1912 , for the right of the crew administrations in the I ##AT##-##AT## st and II ##AT##-##AT## nd world war .
Despite this strange history the Albanian people could develop its own culture of the right .
Lately one very often confounded the usual criminality with the blood revenge .
For the practice of a blood revenge , as we saw above , one had to adhere to certain rules .
The blood revenge is an aspect of a comprehensive juridical system , the customary law .
The habit standards are today really outdated .
The processing of the Kanun exhibits heavy errors .
On the one hand it is considered as backwardly and medieval , in particular if the blood revenge comes to the language .
In addition , on the other hand beautiful things are present , on which one is pride , like hospitality , Besa etc . , which one would gladly still keep .

The ASAP2 Tool ##AT##-##AT## Set consists of three different programs , the ASAP2 Creator , the ASAP2 Updater and the ASAP2 Merger for creating , updating and merging ASAP2 files .
The ASAP2 Creator automatically creates ASAP2 files based on C ##AT##-##AT## code comments .
The ASAP2 Updater updates the address and data type information of an ASAP2 file using a linker map file .
The ASAP2 Merger merges several ASAP2 files to a common ASAP2 file .
An ASAP2 description file contains all information about relevant data objects in the ECU , e.g.
characteristic values ( parameters , curves , maps ) , real and virtual measurement values , and variant dependencies .
Each object is described by information , such as memory address , storage structure , data type , and conversion rules for converting to physical units .
The objects are hierarchically assigned to function groups .
ASAP2 files of all released versions including the current version 1.51 can be read .
The generated output file conforms to ASAP2 version 1.51 .
A prerequisite for use of the ASAP2 Creator is that comments must be inserted in the C ##AT##-##AT## code . ASAP2 ##AT##-##AT## specific information such as data type , conversion rules , min ##AT##-##AT## max conditions , structures , arrays , etc .
Information values can be stored centrally by the use of macros . The ASAP2 Creator reads in this supplemental information and uses it to automatically generate ASAP2 files .
A key advantage of this solution lies in the single source principle , since the supplemental information is stored together in the parameter definition section of the code .
The most current linker map file formats are supported , for example IEEE , COFF , ELF / DWARF , and the ASCII Map formats of many compilers .
Furthermore , the ASAP2 Updater contains a filter function for removing certain objects or object groups .
Detailed information is available in the PDF data sheet .
CANgraph is the tool of choice for user ##AT##-##AT## friendly offline evaluation of the internal measured variables of an ECU and measured data from the CAN / LIN bus or other test equipment .
The measured data recorded during network development , analysis , and ECU calibration can be read into CANgraph in various formats for post ##AT##-##AT## processing .
These include the widely ##AT##-##AT## used MDF format , CSV and ATF formats , and all formats generated by CANalyzer or CANoe .
Furthermore , it is possible to import text files containing measured data organized in tables .
The CANgraph evaluation program displays the recorded measurement data as physical process data in time diagrams .
User ##AT##-##AT## friendly display elements , zoom and measurement functions are provided for the evaluation .
The CANgraph offline evaluation program displays measured data graphically and processes them further .
This makes CANgraph the ideal tool for evaluating measurement data in network development , analysis , and ECU calibration .
On this page , you can see which new features have been implemented into CANgraph since you installed the version you are currently using .
CAN networks are highly tolerant in respect of disturbances of the bus communication and failures .
In order to test whether a system is behaving properly in case of disturbances or failures , a device used to disturb the CAN bus , its physical properties and the logical levels ( recessive and / or dominant ) in a targeted , reproducible way .
CANstress is a standalone hardware module that is inserted directly onto the CAN bus .
It contains various triggering conditions and disturbance logics .
The fullyequipped module includes a number of resistors that can be software ##AT##-##AT## controlled . These resistors are used to force different bus levels onto the bus lines by limiting the voltage supplied .
In this seminar you will get familiar with the world of serial bus systems in the motor vehicle . After an extensive introduction in the world of serial bus systems in the motor vehicle you will become familiar with the most important serial bus systems in the motor vehicle ( CAN , LIN , FlexRay and MOST ) with their current communication protocols .
In each case central subjects are the network architecture , the principle of communication , bus access , framing , data protection , synchronization and the physical data transfer .
In the end the central subjects are concentrated and integrated to a clearly arranged grid . Examples , practices and the possibility to ask questions at all times makes the seminar to a useful event .

The Volkswagen Group has developed a fuel and propulsion strategy in response to the challenges of sustainable mobility .
Our Fuel and Powertrain Strategy describes an evolutionary path to a revolutionary objective : sustainable mobility .
Synthetic fuels contain neither sulphur nor aromatics and have the potential to bring about substantial reductions in vehicle exhaust emissions of nitrous oxides and soot particles .
Fuels from biomass and alternative propulsion systems need public perception and political support .
This is the only way to realize their fast introduction .
Practical trials , pilot systems and long ##AT##-##AT## term studies have already shown that synthetic fuels are now ready for problem ##AT##-##AT## free use .
The brochure about the fuel and propulsion strategy is also available as a PDF ##AT##-##AT## file .
This topic currently forms part of Volkswagen Group Research activities to study feasibility and does not constitute part of series equipment , nor are there currently any plans for series use .

Spacious rooms and useful terrace area .
friendly and helpful landlord. great location in the centre of town .
We had a marvellous time in this appartement . Alexander was the perfect host .
Made special effort to let us check in early at late notice . Apartment is just beautiful and originally designed / considered , including the art on the walls .
The view &apos;s , plenty of space , perfect location , Cristina was very helpful .
Location and atmosphere of the place is great .
We had very pleasant stay in there .
The apartment itself was comfortable and clean and distance from the centre of Lisbon was good .
We did not meet the owner as he did not speak English but met his mother instead and she was extremely pleasant to deal with .
The apartment is excelent , at Estrela , not far from the center , served by many ways of transportation , specially the tram 28 , that itself is a &quot; city tour &quot; through Lisboa . There &apos;s only one problem ( for elder people ) : the stairs to the apartment are difficult to climb .
Apartment is very spacious with good kitchen facility for preparation of meals .

The benevolent titans created the Emerald Dream to serve as the underlying blueprint for the planet Azeroth .
Located outside the physical boundaries of Azeroth , the Dream is a lush and primal forest : the world that Azeroth might have become , had it developed without interference from the sentient races ( e.g. , technological advances , urbanization , and wars ) .
Although the Dream is beautiful , its primal savagery can also be deadly .
The Dream is under the protection of the green Dragon Aspect , Ysera .
After the titans had shaped Azeroth , they sent Ysera into an eternal trance and charged her with watching over all of Azeroth from the Dream .
As a result , green dragons guard every portal into the Dream , and they always see both the landscape of Azeroth and the corresponding dreamscape .
This enchanted vision , known as dreamsight , allows green dragons to perceive their surroundings with perfect clarity despite the dragons &apos; closed eyes .
Unlike Azeroth , the Emerald Dream is a realm that is primarily spiritual instead of physical .
All who enter the Dream can affect it to a minor extent , but only temporarily : the underlying structure of the Dream inevitably reasserts itself .
Even Ysera cannot change the Dream permanently , nor , indeed , would she wish to do so .
She does not control the Dream ; on the contrary , it is closer to the truth to say that the Dream controls her .
Using the Dream as her unfaltering guide , she regulates the ebb and flow of nature and the evolutionary path of the world itself .
The creatures of Azeroth can visit the Emerald Dream either physically or via dreams , as the realm &apos;s name indicates .
When an individual &apos;s spirit visits the Dream , leaving the body behind , that individual will manifest his or her dreamform , which normally looks and behaves much as that individual &apos;s physical body might .
Hence , for most creatures , moving through the Dream is achieved in the normal fashion , despite the realm &apos;s chiefly spiritual character .
These rules do not apply to druids of sufficient skill or experience , who are trained to see beyond physical reality .
These druids might be capable of abnormal movement in the Dream ( e.g. , a night elf who can sprint at a greatly accelerated rate , walk through solid objects , or fly ) .
It is quite rare to see such unusual capabilities in non ##AT##-##AT## druids , but it is not beyond the realm of possibility .
The Dream can be affected by all dreamers to a minor and temporary extent .
However , no living creature except the titans has ever been able to permanently change the Dream .
Ysera herself cannot control or shape the Dream , which has its own ecology and a variety of inhabitants , both sentient and non ##AT##-##AT## sentient .
Time is meaningless inside the Dream .
As a result , the green dragonflight , which spends the majority of its time in the Dream , is extremely long ##AT##-##AT## lived .
Ysera &apos;s consorts in particular almost never emerge from the Dream and are effectively immortal , as are all other permanent denizens in the Dream .
Because the titans invested a great deal of work in perfecting their design of Azeroth , the Emerald Dream is not one a single perfect vision of what Azeroth would become .
The finished design of the planet was the product of many previous flawed or unfinished models .
The Dream therefore has multiple layers , one for each of these earlier incarnations .
These older layers of the Dream are often incomplete and therefore limited in scope , relative to the finalized Dream .
After the War of the Ancients , three of the Dragon Aspects grew a World Tree , Nordrassil , atop the new Well of Eternity , and Ysera linked Nordrassil to the Emerald Dream .
Her action was primarily meant to prevent abuse of the Well and to keep the Well &apos;s powers from growing .
The tempering energies of the Dream act as a calming influence on the Well &apos;s chaotic energies .
Secondarily , Nordrassil &apos;s connection to the Emerald Dream allowed the druids of Azeroth to travel easily to the Dream .
Since that time , all druids have periodically hibernated while their spirits wandered the dreamways .
This hibernation is not some sort of physical requirement for druids , though ; rather , the hibernation was a communion with the Emerald Dream .
The druids were learning more about the natural world through the Dream . There was always something new for the druids to learn , even in the smallest blade of grass .
During the Third War , the druids empowered Nordrassil with the night elves &apos; immortality and the energies of countless night elf spirits .
Nordrassil then gave off a blast of energy that killed the demon lord Archimonde , ending the war and sealing the Burning Legion &apos;s defeat on Azeroth .
Although Nordrassil was not killed in the process , the night elves &apos; noble sacrifice left them mortal and cost the druids their easily accessible link to the Emerald Dream .
Thus , reaching the Dream has become a significantly more difficult prospect , and fewer druids are able to walk the Dream today .
Certain that the night elves &apos; immortality could be restored , Archdruid Fandral Staghelm proposed growing a second World Tree , though the dragons showed no sign of offering their assistance in the process .
Archdruid Malfurion Stormrage flatly refused ; he argued that without the blessing of the dragonflights , the tree would be an abomination .
When Malfurion fell into a mysterious coma , Fandral became the new leader of the druids .
His first act was to persuade the rest of the Cenarion Circle to grow the second World Tree , which they named Teldrassil .
Teldrassil is not linked to the Dream or to the Well of Eternity .
Contrary to Fandral &apos;s hopes , the new World Tree has not restored the night elves &apos; immortality .
Something terrible has entered the Dream : the Emerald Nightmare .
Four green dragons , once the proud lieutenants of Ysera , have gone insane , and their noble forms have been warped almost beyond recognition .
The powers these ghastly dragons wield are twisted and evil mockeries of their former abilities .
Worse yet , these dragons seem to be taking out their rage and frustration on the creatures of Azeroth .
Thus far , neither the druids nor the dragons have been able to discover the Nightmare &apos;s origin .
Only one thing is clear : as long as the Nightmare continues to darken the Emerald Dream , corrupted green dragons will sew terror and madness throughout the world .

XLSTAT , Statistical software for MS Excel - Statistics and data analysis with MS Excel : Tutorials : What is Preference Mapping ?
This tutorial was inspired by &#91; Schlich P , McEwan J.A.
Sciences des aliments , 12 , pp 339 ##AT##-##AT## 355 &#93; and by exchanges between the Addinsoft development team and some experts of sensory data analysis .
As the capacity to summarize of the preference map diminishes with the number of consumers ( the number of axes to interpret increases ) , a non ##AT##-##AT## metric PCA is sometimes used to reduce the number of necessary axes . The non ##AT##-##AT## metric PCA consists of a monotone transform of the data so that the variability explained by the k ( k = 2 or 3 ) first axes is maximized .
This transform implies that we consider the ratings have an ordinal meaning , and that the distances or ratios between the ratings are not important .
To reduce the number of axes you might also want to group the consumers and to perform the PCA with the groups as variables .
Internal preference mapping allows to generate a map on which one can identify the consumers &apos; or groups of consumers preferences represented as vectors .
Contrary to what is done with internal preference mapping , the first step consists in mapping the products on the basis of their characteristics . This can be obtained by running a Principal Component Analysis ( PCA ) , a Correspondence Analysis ( CA ) or a Generalized Procrustes Analysis ( GPA ) .
This first visualization is named sensory map . By applying the PREFMAP method , we then model for each consumer ( or group of consumers ) the ratings that have been given to the products , using as explanatory variables the characteristics of the products , with the aim of representing the consumers on the sensory map .
- Circular ideal point model : The bi are equal and the cij are null . The model corresponds to a hyperquadric hypersurface .
If the surface has a maximum in terms of preference we will talk of an ideal point .
With the circular model it is possible to trace isopreference circular lines around the ideal or anti ##AT##-##AT## ideal point .
- Elliptical ideal point model : The cij are null .
In this case the isopreference lines are ellipses , which makes the interpretation of the distances of the products to the ideal or anti ##AT##-##AT## ideal points more complex .
If the bi have opposite signs , there is no ideal or anti ##AT##-##AT## ideal point but only a saddle point which interpretation is tricky .
- Quadratic surface model : This model corresponds to the complete model which shape is a hypersurface .
This model allows to take into account interactions between the characteristics ( the cijXiXj .
How do I run Preference Mapping with XLSTAT ##AT##-##AT## MX ?
The following example shows how one can create a preference map using the PREFMAP method .
An Excel sheet with both the data and the results can be downloaded by clicking here .
- The consumer acceptability data : 99 consumers rated 10 different commercial samples of potato crisps .
These data have been obtained from the article by Schlich and McEwan ( 1992 ) .
The ratings have been discritized from 1 to 30 ( 30 corresponds to the highest acceptability ) .
These data are stored in a 99 x 10 table .
- The average ratings computed from the ratings given by 8 experts to the 10 crisps samples for 4 texture attributes and 7 flavor attributes .
These data , simulated for the purpose of teaching by the author of this tutorial on the basis of the article by Schlich and McEwan ( 1992 ) , make up a 10 x 11 table .
We first create the sensory map by applying a PCA on the 10 x 11 table .
This gives us a two ##AT##-##AT## dimensional visualization of the crisps .
As a tutorial is dedicated to PCA , we do not elaborate on that subject here .
The dialog box of the PCA has been filled in as shown below .
With the PCA we projected the chips on a 2 ##AT##-##AT## dimensional sensory map . Before being able to position the consumers on the map to know which consumer prefers what type of chips , we want to group the consumers into homogeneous clusters in order to obtain a map that is visually satisfactory .
We now focus on the ratings given by the 99 consumers .
As the number of consumers is significant , we decided to group them into homogeneous groups in order to make the PREFMAP results easier to interpret .
We chose the Agglomerative Hierarchical Clustering ( AHC ) .
As a tutorial is dedicated to AHC , we do not elaborate on that subject here .
The dialog box of the AHC has been filled in as shown below .
We then re ##AT##-##AT## run the AHC while specifying that we request 9 clusters . The dialog box has been filled in as displayed below .
The only difference with the previous case is that we ask for a truncation .
We then store the centroids of the clusters for the last step of the analysis . The table is copied and paste ( Edit / Paste special with Transposed option ) in a new sheet named &quot; Clusters &apos; pref .
In the &quot; Options tab &quot; to select the best model among the four possible models , we used an F ##AT##-##AT## ratio test , with a 0.1 ( 10 % ) significance level . That means that if a more complex model does not give an F ##AT##-##AT## ratio with a p ##AT##-##AT## value lower than 0.1 the more complex model is rejected .
We selected the coefficients of the model to determine the length of the vectors on the preference map .
The results we obtain ( see below ) show that the vector model is the best model for the clusters 3 to 9 . For cluster 1 the quadratic model performs best .
However , it is not significant . The circular model is the best model for cluster 2 and it is significant .
For the quadratic model retained for cluster 1 , we do not have an ideal point but a saddle point .
The saddle point represents a threshold where the variability of the preference is low , before inscreasing ( or decreasing in the opposit direction ) quicker . For cluster 2 we have an anti ##AT##-##AT## ideal point .
The anti ##AT##-##AT## ideal point corresponds to the lowest preference for the group .
The preference map allows to quickly interpret the results . When looking at both the preference map and the correlations circle of the PCA , we see that the consumers of cluster 3 prefer chips that are not melting , but not too overcooked and crispy .
Consumers from cluster 6 like crispy chips and dislike greasy chips . For cluster 2 it is hard to know what they prefer , but it seems that they strongly dislike ( anti ##AT##-##AT## ideal point ) a chip that would be salty and average for all the criteria ( the point is close to the origin ) .
The contour plot allows to see how many clusters have a preference above average in a given region of the preference map ( this is determined using all the fitted models ) .
The preference orders for the various groups of consumers are displayed .
We notice that the crisp 4 , characterized by an earthy , not sweet and not salty taste , is not liked at all by clusters 1 , 4 , 6 , 7 and 8 . Chips 8 is the prefered one for most clusters , except by cluster 9 .
The marketing and R &amp; D teams will be able to take this information into account to direct their creation of new crisps towards the right directions .

The contents of this internal buffer may be copied into a string variable using ob ##UNDERSCORE## get ##UNDERSCORE## contents ( ) .
To output what is stored in the internal buffer , use ob ##UNDERSCORE## end ##UNDERSCORE## flush ( ) . Alternatively , ob ##UNDERSCORE## end ##UNDERSCORE## clean ( ) will silently discard the buffer contents .

If you are using table , column , or routine privileges for even one user , the server examines table , column , and routine privileges for all users and this slows down MySQL a bit . Similarly , if you limit the number of queries , updates , or connections for any users , the server must monitor these values .

The fans of the trendy Command &amp; Conquer series ( and this refers to the official Commander &amp; Conquer series ) have required a lot of patience .
It has been quiet around the Brotherhood of NOD and the Global Defensive Initiative ( GDI ) after the Tiberian Sun and its add ##AT##-##AT## on “ Firestorm ” since 1999 .
Now after 7 years of silence , the two stalwart wranglers reappear in public .
Till now 4 Patches for Command &amp; Conquer 3 : Tiberium Wars have appeared , which can rectify the biggest errors .
It is presumed , that the Brotherhood will destroy itself slowly through the internal struggles for power . However at the beginning of the game NOD succeeds in blasting the orbiting command station Philadelphia , the headquarters of the GDI , and with it all the senior most generals of the world police .
One can decide between two campaigns in the Main Menu .
You can either finally release the world ( whoever believes that will be blessed ) from the Brotherhood of NOD in a 17 ##AT##-##AT## part campaign or you support Kane ’ s relentless thirst for power and move on the side of the Brotherhood in another 17 missions against the much detested GDI .
A novelty , which would bring tears to the eyes of some C &amp; C veterans , the game has been extended to bring in a third group ( Scrin ) .
An extraterrestrial race , which also wishes to conquer Tiberium .
The campaign of the Scrin can be started only after the campaign of GDI and NOD have been concluded and contains 4 missions .
The campaigns run parallel to one another as is the case in all Command &amp; Conquer Series .
As a player you have to free the White House from the clutches of the Brotherhood together with GDI , whereas under Kane ’ s command you have to capture the White House .
C &amp; C Fans will feel at home immediately when they start the first mission and see the usual construction bar on the right edge of the screen .
There have been no basic changes in the controls in the strategy epos . The tried and tested features were retained , and a few new but practical features have been added .
Thus for example the surveyor on the side of GDI . Those are units , which allow us to expand our base over the normal zone around the builder ’ s yard .
Very useful , with the discovery of a Tiberium field , which should be scoured without having to undergo the long travelling hours of the collector .
And here we would arrive at a small weakness of Command &amp; Conquer 3 .
The collectors ..... We know the situation only too well from the two predecessors ( Tiberium conflict and Tiberian Sun ) , in which our Tiberium harvester clumsily drives in an area occupied by the enemy and under bombardment works at peaceful dismantling .
There has been no changes in Tiberium Wars in this either .
The AI faces old familiar problems .
Thus it can happen that the adversaries simply ignore the fact that a building has to be destroyed .
So units face obstacles , instead of running around them .
Even the much promised flexibility of the AI is not available on any of the 3 perceptible levels of difficulty .
So we were able to take an enemy base apart without problems with a number of mammoth tankers , while the adversary tried to force our tanks to flee with foot soldiers .
This does not mean that the game is tactically undemanding .
The missions are all established on a good fair tactical level .
The presentation of Command &amp; Conquer 3 fulfils all wishes .
The interim sequences played with real actors are shown wonderfully in the scene and are a continuous motivation from one mission to the next .
Unfortunately the synchronization into German is not that good .
Actors talk without moving their lips , or move their lips without saying anything .
In the case of politicians that is nothing new , but we are used to better service from the C &amp; C series .
We recommend urgently that you buy the Kane Edition ( uncut and multilingual - &gt; install in English ) .
Otherwise an essential part of the atmosphere of the treasured interim sequences is lost by the “ nerving factor ” .
EA has succeeded very well with the design of the mission .
We can build up our base in a mission and will regularly receive reinforcements , while we have to escort our construction vehicle under the most severe bombardment to a practically broken base for reconstruction .
The 3 groups bring credible differences with it .
Whereas GDI attacks with strongly armored units , NOD lies in ambush with camouflaged though week armored units .
The Scrin on the other hand has a teleportation of its own and the intellectual control of enemy units .
All in all it is a successful mixture .
The balancing has not been developed so completely as is normal in Command &amp; Conquer .
So Scrin is a bit to strong and the avatars of NOD , when they are well ##AT##-##AT## equipped , difficult to beat .
Besides the AI in the single player mode is somewhat unfair , when every second foot soldiers waddle out of he barracks . We are convinced that EA will repair this with a patch .
Even Multiplayer friends get their money ’ s worth .
With maximal 8 comrades you could make the 20 ( in the normal edition ) given cards unsafe .
With the excellent graphic engine the switches 1 A appear and make each game an experience .
The balancing difficulties of the single player campaign does not effect the multiplayer part of the game .
Thus Scrin can teleport without an effort in the enemy basis and even the defense towers of the rivals are not obstacles for the Scrin , thanks to the distance attack possibility of their units .
Here a patch should be of assistance !
EA has succeeded with a very big drama in Tiberium Wars .
Old familiar C &amp; C feelings mixed with the wonderful optics make it inevitably clear that Command &amp; Conquer in spite of severe rivalry remains the unchallenged strategy king .
Thumbs up for Command &amp; Conquer 3 : Tiberium Wars !

Placing legal or practical restrictions on the comprehension or modification of a program , such as mandatory purchase of special licenses , signing of a Non ##AT##-##AT## Disclosure ##AT##-##AT## Agreement ( NDA ) or - for programming languages that have multiple forms or representation - making the preferred human way of comprehending and editing a program ( &quot; source code &quot; ) inaccessible also makes it proprietary ( non ##AT##-##AT## free ) .
Without the freedom to modify a program , people will remain at the mercy of a single vendor .
Software can be copied / distributed at virtually no cost .
If you are not allowed to give a program to a person in need , that makes a program non ##AT##-##AT## free .
This can be done for a charge , if you so choose .
The freedom to improve the program , and release your improvements to the public , so that the whole community benefits .
Not everyone is an equally good programmer in all fields .
Some people don &apos;t know how to program at all .
This freedom allows those who do not have the time or skills to solve a problem to indirectly access the freedom to modify .
This can be done for a charge .
These freedoms are rights , not obligations , although respecting these freedoms for society may at times oblige the individual .
Any person can choose to not make use of them , but may also choose to make use of all of them .
In particular , it should be understood that Free Software does not exclude commercial use .
If a program fails to allow commercial use and commercial distribution , it is not Free Software .
Indeed a growing number of companies base their business model completely or at least partially on Free Software , including some of the largest proprietary software vendors .
Free Software makes it legal to provide help and assistance , it does not make it mandatory .
English seems to be the only language in which such a strong ambiguity exists between freedom and price .
When translated into other languages , Free Software becomes &quot; logiciels libre &quot; in French , &quot; software libre &quot; in Spanish , &quot; software libero &quot; in Italian , &quot; Fri Software &quot; in Danish or whatever is the equivalent term in the local language referring to freedom .
On February 3rd 1998 , in the wake of Netscapes announcement to release their browser as Free Software , a group of people met in Palo Alto in the Silicon Valley and proposed to start a marketing campaign for Free Software using the term &quot; Open Source .
&quot; The goal was to seek fast commercialisation of Free Software and acceptance of Free Software by the companies and venture capitalists of the booming new economy .
As a means to this end , they made a conscious decision to leave aside all long ##AT##-##AT## term issues ( such as philosophy , ethics and social effects ) related to Free Software , feeling these posed obstacles in the way of rapid acceptance by economy .
Often used in good faith by people who refer to what Free Software stands for , the term &quot; Open Source &quot; - originally defined to mean the same thing as Free Software in terms of licenses and implementation - has seen inflationary usage .
When the European Commission started dealing with Free Software on a regular basis , they sought to avoid the ambiguity of the English word &quot; Free Software &quot; and the misunderstandings of &quot; Open Source &quot; alike , which led to the adoption of a third term which has popped up occasionally since around 1992 : &quot; Libre Software .
&quot; This term has proven resistant to inflationary usage and is still used in an identical way to Free Software .
So it may pose a solution for those who fear being misunderstood when speaking English .
&#91; 3 &#93; For reference , see http : / / www.opensource.org / advocacy / faq.html : How is &quot; open source &quot; related to &quot; free software &quot; ?
&#91; 4 &#93; In this program governments and intergovernmental organisations pay substantial fees for a superficial look at some parts of Windows sourcecode in special Microsoft facilities .
This may increase &quot; felt security &quot; but is essentially useless - especially since they do not even know whether what they looked at is what they have on their computers .
And of course it does not give them freedom .

We , the undersigned , share a vision of Europe as a lively , creative and competitive part of the world .
This vision is based on the principles of participative democracy and the freedom to innovate ; these rely on Europeans being free to develop software and to distribute their work , free from the threat and the restrictions of software patents .
Information and Communication Technologies ( ICT ) play a central role in all areas of the economy today , and they are the foundation of the knowledge economy , in which Europe continues to excel .
Our vision is to see the European ICT industry become the most vibrant in the world - and the European Parliament shared this vision , when it made the necessary amendments to the directive on computer ##AT##-##AT## implemented inventions during its first reading on 24 September 2003 .
That directive is better known as software patent directive because in its original version it not only allowed patents on computer ##AT##-##AT## aided inventions , it also allowed patents on the algorithms and logic of the software itself .
In what was the one of the best and most laudable examples of democratic participation , companies and non ##AT##-##AT## profit organisations together outlined the likely harmful consequences to democracy , competition , innovation and employment .
On 18 May 2004 the Council of the European Union frustrated those democratically ##AT##-##AT## reached positions - they restored the original proposal with unlimited patentability of software .
They ultimately adopted this position on 7 March 2005 in defiance of regional and national political processes , as well as the scientific findings by the German Monopolkommission , which regularly reports about dangers to competition to the Federal Government of Germany ; the Massachussetts Institute of Technology ( MIT ) ; the Boston University School of Law ; Deutsche Bank Research ; Price Waterhouse Coopers ; and the US Federal Trade Commission .
Patents on software are among the worst threats to knowledge ##AT##-##AT## based industries , by restricting software development : they make computers less secure , less reliable and prevent competition on a basic level .
Lack of competition and uncalculable legal risks raise the cost of ICT and cost jobs wherever the economy depends upon them .
The most essential discoveries in the field of ICT were successful because they were not patented , for instance the invention of the World Wide Web by Tim Berners ##AT##-##AT## Lee .
If software patents are enacted , the world will never know which discovery could have been the next World Wide Web .
On 6 July 2005 , the directive will once again enter the European Parliament for its second reading : In the interest of Europe and its democratic roots we urge you to once more make the necessary amendments to turn this software patent directive into a directive that allows patents on computer ##AT##-##AT## aided inventions , but clearly prevents software patenting .

A myEUROPE Chat is an activity , which adds together pupils , teachers and experts to discuss on ##AT##-##AT## line about European issues .
Its goal is to communicate on ##AT##-##AT## line in a light , easy and informal manner .
Participants could be in different parts of the world ; they sit in front of their computers and &apos; chat &apos; .
People in on ##AT##-##AT## line chat sessions type messages to each other using their keyboards .
The message then immediately appears on the screens of all the participants .
A &apos; chatroom &apos; is an electronic space , typically a Web site where people can go to communicate in real ##AT##-##AT## time .
Chatrooms are usually focused on specific topics .
The &apos; moderator &apos; is the person who is responsible for the chat .
She / he makes sure that people stick to the chat rules and can ban those who don &apos;t .
A &apos; nickname &apos; is a substitute name used while chatting . It is strongly recommended to avoid using real names .
If you don &apos;t want to take part in the chat , don &apos;t log in .
Usually a chat is moderated and has a specific topic .
Ask questions , then wait and watch for replies .
Be fast , accurate , spontaneous and type short sentences .
During the session you do not see the faces of your partners .
Never give out private information openly in a chat : passwords , credit card details , drivers license , numbers , home address etc .
3. close the window application at the end to leave .
Participation in a chat is based on an e ##AT##-##AT## mail invitation , which includes a link to the chat .
If your Internet provider has a firewall you need to get your system administrator to open up port 8000 and 6667 during the chat session .
These guidelines are also available in Spanish and Dutch , in pdf format .

In the course of one &apos;s life , everyone is highly likely to be unpleasantly confronted with a toothache .
It belongs to the most frequently occurring pains .
They appear in connection with tooth ailments such as caries , parodontosis or after tooth treatment .
Toothaches are generally seen as being very unpleasant .
The pain can be piercing , pointed , dull , light or throbbing .
If the dental pulp is damaged by caries , a dull , deep and difficult to locate pain ensues .
In the case of a suppurating inflammation of the dental pulp , the pain will be a pulsating one .
The teeth will then be sensitive to heat and a knocking touch .
In this case , a painful treatment of the root will often be necessary .
With parodontosis , the dental neck will be very sensitive due to receding gums .
Pain is triggered by touch , heat , cold as well as a number of foodstuffs .
Paranasal sinusitis resulting from a cold , too , can make teeth sensitive to pressure and pain .
With successful treatment of the cause , the toothache will disappear .
Caries is the main cause for toothaches .
Poor oral hygiene will result in bacteria building up organic acids from left over food particles , which in turn lead to caries .
Daily and careful dental hygiene as well as regular check ##AT##-##AT## ups with the dentist are decisive factors in a successful preventive scheme .
Next time you see your dentist , question him about useful hints and tips relating to tooth care .
In the event of a toothache , the visit to a dentist is unavoidable .
Pain killers should only be used temporarily until the dentist &apos;s treatment has been successfully concluded .

SGML enables management of multiple formats of a document .
One easy SGML system is Debiandoc , which is used here .
In SGML , the first definition of an entity wins .

Several years ago we coined the term &quot; communication guerilla &quot; to designate a number of political praxis forms - praxis forms that traverse the old boundaries between political action and the everyday world , subjective anger and rational political action , art and politics , desire and work , theory and practice .
In other words , the term does not denote an organization like Globalize Resistance , nor a political network like Attac , nor any of the more complex , rhizomatic and continuously newly constituted formations of the global protest movement , such as People &apos;s Global Action &#91; www.agp.org &#93; or the European noborder network &#91; www.noborder.org &#93; .
The imaginary brigades of communication guerillas are not necessarily networked with one another .
What joins them is a specific style of political action drawing from a watchful view of the paradoxes and absurdities of power , turning these into the starting point for political interventions by playing with representations and identities , with alienation and over ##AT##-##AT## identification .
As it emerged in the 90s , the concept &quot; communication guerilla &quot; was , not least of all , a response to the exhaustion of traditional leftist activism after the fall of the Berlin wall .
The search for new forms of praxis led ( at least in some points ) to a new , transversal praxis beyond the realm of the &quot; old &quot; activism - even though the point of departure for this search was the experience of a seminal defeat of the left .
Today , following the rise and possibly already the incipient downfall of a new global movement , the situation is a different one , and the question arises as to the extent to which this concept from the 90s is still useful .
The new activism has become more global , more networked , but most of all , it has developed a new dynamic beyond political and national borders .
At the same time , however , this activism still evinces many features of the old polit ##AT##-##AT## activism , not only in the neo ##AT##-##AT## communist party version of the SWP ( Socialist Workers Party ) and Globalize Resistance .
Despite all the rhetoric , activism often still has a stance that is strangely separated from people &apos;s everyday life , even that of its own protagonists .
The future of this global activism will depend on whether it succeeds in being capable of action at the local level , the level of everyday life , while continuing to develop its transversal , border ##AT##-##AT## crossing character at the same time .
The most important border that has to be crossed is the border that constitutes the activist her or himself in a separation from the &quot; rest &quot; of society .
We think that the praxis of the communication guerilla can contribute to this kind of border ##AT##-##AT## crossing .
This is our motivation for discussing in the following text experiences with this praxis along the lines of flight that are inscribed in it , along the border ##AT##-##AT## crossings , through which it is constituted .
A web site &#91; www.gatt.org &#93; that turns the self ##AT##-##AT## presentation of the WTO right side up : an inattentive conference assistant enters the words WTO into a search engine - and a representative of the Yes Men can appear as a representative for the World Trade Organization at a congress for international law &#91; www.theyesmen.org &#93; , transforming the conference into a slapstick scenario .
We encounter the same Yes Men shortly after the protests in Prague , costumed as &quot; Captain Euro &quot; at a demo against repression and arrests in front of the Czech consulate , but also at the Ars Electronica Festival in Linz , at art events in Barcelona , Vienna or London - is it all an artistic end in itself or political action ?
The campaign against the German deportation airline Lufthansa &#91; www.deportation ##AT##-##AT## alliance.com &#93; starts with a poster exhibition ( &quot; Deportation Class &quot; ) that attacks the airline &apos;s self ##AT##-##AT## presentation and links it with the theme of deportations .
This exhibition tours through German art institutions , while the corporation simultaneously attacks the Internet version of the same pictures with furious legal threats .
This , too , is an uninhibited way of dealing with the border between art and politics .
It is not the question of which of the two fields a project should be attributed to that is interesting , but rather : Does it work ?
How does one manage to make a fool of a seemingly over ##AT##-##AT## powerful institution or person and possibly even partially force them to take a defensive position ?
Communication guerilla differs from traditional political forms of action in that it consciously draws from the density of meanings of images and narrations .
We are tired of private security services and the omnipresent purchase obligation , the removal of park benches that forces passers ##AT##-##AT## by into cappuccino bars or to just move on .
We know about the privatization of inner cities , the disappearance of public space .
But how is it possible to intervene against the apparent automatism of these processes - with an information event ?
Or how would it be , if there were suddenly an obstacle , a break in the Saturday business of the pedestrian zone - not a colorful street theater or exhibition project providing information about the limitations and constraints of privatized urban space , but rather something else that makes it possible to see and experience these constraints , a test arrangement , in which the users of the shopping street are assigned their actual roles , but in an exaggerated form ?
The images : a pedestrian zone -- lifestyle shops , cafes , buying , street musicians and idlers , who are discreetly expelled from the square , advertising stocks , black ##AT##-##AT## clothed security at the portals of noble shopping passages ... construction sites .. red and white barriers in the flow of the promenading crowd ... a large square area in the middle of a city square is blocked by red and white ribbons , flanked by security guards in black jeans and white T ##AT##-##AT## shirts .
Friendly employees wearing the company logo address passers ##AT##-##AT## by , the same logo is repeated at an information table .
Information sheets with a questionnaire about the use of the pedestrian zone are distributed : How often do you come into the city ?
How much do you expect to spend today ?
The questionnaires are used to determine permission to cross the area or not .
The narration : &quot; We are conducting this survey for the company Bienle , which is contemplating the purchase of the entire Castle Square .
We are using this test arrangement to determine the user profile of the area to be purchased , in terms of profitability .
The barricade is executed precisely , the body language of the security guards radiates uncompromisingness , the company employees operate smoothly and in a friendly manner , but firmly ; the corporate identity is thoroughly and professionally styled , all the way from the company logo to the outfit for the &quot; staff &quot; .
The activists adapt the language of power , the plausible over ##AT##-##AT## identification is implemented through precise and reflected observation , an eye for aesthetic details and a professional way of dealing with materials .
This action was carried out by the politically active artist group 01 , but it was not identified as an art action -- except to a few irritated members of the police force , who had obviously not been informed by the &quot; Bienzle Company &quot; ahead of time .
The art label was thus employed here only instrumentally as camouflage and protective shield .
For the passers ##AT##-##AT## by , the action was an irritating reality resulting in a subjective experience of the fact of the privatization process in their city , forcing them to take a position more than an information or protest event would have done .
It is also imaginable that a project like this could be conducted in the framework of an art festival -- there , however , the predominant framework of interpretation for outside observers would not have been &quot; privatization &quot; or &quot; intervention in the freedom of movement &quot; , but rather &quot; art &quot; : the same project , conducted within the boundaries of an art space , produces tame artistic social criticism , not communication guerilla .
It is also imaginable that a project like this could be exhibited in a museum -- the art business &apos; current greed for contact with &quot; authentic &quot; actors makes it possible .
&#91; 2 &#93; The Yes Men subsequently exhibited their appearance as &quot; Captain Euro &quot; as a video installation at worldinformation.org in Vienna &#91; www.theyesmen.org &#93; .
At the same event , a technical device for checking irises regulated the turnstile at the entrance .
Here criticism of the surveillance possibilities of the control society take the form of technical playfulness in keeping with the site of the presentation , the Technical Museum .
The potential of an action depends on the context , this determines which codes the audience uses to read it .
It attempts to criticize the rules of normality by creating irritations and ambiguities , thus enabling new ways of reading familiar images and signs .
The criticism of naturalized power structures first requires making these visible -- and they become visible where the smooth functioning of the sign systems and interpretation mechanisms starts to get stuck .
This is hardly possible , however , within the framework of art operations : the general interpretation framework of &quot; art &quot; has the effect of a kind of lubrication that makes it possible for the viewer to easily swallow even the crudest provocation .
Radically slandering the established art scene , for example , has long since been legitimized and thus defused as a modus of the artistic avant ##AT##-##AT## garde .
Mixing up images and signs by employing artistic techniques first becomes exciting , when it leaves the integrating framework of art behind .
&quot; Is it not better to distort the signs than to destroy them ?
The militant leftist scene works hard at signs , too , their actions are also symbolic -- yet here it is a matter of the gesture of a military attack , of the destruction of signs : paving stones into the windows of banks , the obligatory trashing of a McDonalds branch , the battle with robo ##AT##-##AT## cops .
The significance of this praxis of signs with its staging of battle , revolts , tumults , should not be underestimated .
It is not without reason that the Seattle riot functions as a sign , simultaneously symbolizing and catalyzing the emergence of a new global movement .
The media treatment of this riot catapulted the image of a militant resistance against the abstract lack of alternatives of the capitalist economy into the eye of the public .
This image -- a war machine opposing the abstract war machine of global capital -- developed a huge mobilizing impact .
At the same time , though , militant resistance is always already integrated in the mythology of parliamentary western democracy .
In the bourgeois media , the images dwindle into an illustration of basic democratic principles : the ones to &quot; blame &quot; for the street battles are a few wicked hooligans , who functionalize the peaceful , colorful protest for their own purposes .
The &quot; Black Block &quot; does not uphold the basic rules of non ##AT##-##AT## violent protest , the recognition of private property , the democratic game rules , and must therefore be restrained with a massive police presence .
This figure of argumentation legitimizes not only the violent appearance of state power , but also the right of the globalization managers to continue to make their decisions without public scrutiny .
However , the example of global protests can also be used to show the effectiveness of the tactical distortion of signs .
The warrior is a fighting woman in pink , she is a samba dancer . A year later in Genoa , it was martians , UFOs , the U ##AT##-##AT## NO men and women soldiers of the PublixTheatreCaravan , bikini girls , tire men , and others that distorted and alienated the firmly fixed image of what a radical demonstration is supposed to look like and how it is to act .
We have the feeling that the self ##AT##-##AT## image of many militant activists holds the danger of thinking of oneself as separate from the rest of society : an activist subculture is emerging with its own signs , its own values , and its own patterns of legitimization .
Resistance derives its legitimacy from the authenticity of the use of one &apos;s own body , the intensity of one &apos;s commitment .
There are lamentations about the isolation of the activist ghetto , but at the same time , the &quot; purity &quot; of one &apos;s own side is anxiously maintained , the rhetoric of confrontation and the apocalyptic millenarianism of the activists camp clearly separates it from mainstream society . This separation also finds expression in the turbulent discussions about contacts with the mainstream media , or in the laboriousness of attempts to make contact with the neighborhood of squatted houses .
Despite occasional collaboration , one is distrustful not only of the often narcissist art world , but also of the &quot; geeks &quot; , the cyberactivists of the 90s , who flocked around events like the &quot; next 5 minutes &quot; congress in Amsterdam .
A playful way of dealing with signs , images and meanings , allowing for hybridity and complexity , could contribute to partially breaking down these demarcations . In an optimistic scenario , the paradoxical meeting of two marginal social fields , the art scene and polit ##AT##-##AT## activism , could lead to the emergence of a transversal art ##AT##-##AT## polit ##AT##-##AT## activism that overcomes the boundaries and limitations of the respective scenes .
It is not a coincidence that communication guerilla forms and techniques are often used with projects that arise on occasions like this , forms that can stimulate the pleasurable appropriation of artistic methods in political work as well as the politically effective employment of artistic potentials .
The environment of the global protests creates a social space of its own in the form of an activist subculture that transgresses national borders and is constituted through manifold digital and physical networks . Sometimes it seems that the networking itself and the mastery of its tools are ( still ) the most important result of this movement .
People meet again -- not only at the next global protest , but also at biennales and film festivals , at Documenta and Ars Electronica . The interaction between art and political scenes is still intermittent , communicated through a few hyperactivists oscillating between art and politics .
A stronger interaction , which could become the starting point for a broader transversal praxis , still needs to be developed in concrete projects . The art scene &apos;s current interest in &quot; real social life &quot; can provide an impetus for this ; the possibilities for succeeding in the art market with resistive practices will also play a role .
The media image of the activist , as well as his self ##AT##-##AT## image ( for the person represented is usually a &quot; he &quot; ) reduce the activist to the practice of action .
It seems as though these people do nothing else but occupy buildings and organize demonstrations -- just as the artist is also reduced to his projects and products in the public view .
Both , however , the artist and the activist , are normally quite different .
They work in agriculture or in construction , as seasonal laborers , professional charity donation collectors , in social work , or as part ##AT##-##AT## time employees in offices and call ##AT##-##AT## centers ; they teach at language schools , adult education centers or universities .
Not least of all , they work in the field of new media -- graphics and web design , network administrators , computer specialists .
They move in the working world and simultaneously in an activist world that has its own calendar , its own temporal and spatial order .
This is nothing new ( the artist Franz Kafka was an administrative employee , too ) ; what is new though , in our opinion , is the increasing integration of knowledge , lifestyle and resources from both areas .
Just as it is still customary in some trades to take tools during the lunch break in production for one &apos;s own needs , office copy machines are used for the production of flyers , information material is run through the company postage machine .
Various indymedia sites are largely updated from places of work .
On the other hand , many media workers have their means of production , like computers and video cameras , at home and can use them not only for work , but also for political actions .
Most of all , though , the knowledge of the dominant discourse and the predominant aesthetics constantly glides from one area to another , can be used both for reproduction and for criticism of existing power relationships .
Here the border ##AT##-##AT## crossing goes in both directions : knowledge about how to arrange texts that activist desktop ##AT##-##AT## publishers acquire through faking city information brochures or official letterheads , is also useful for paid commissioned work .
Those who conversely reproduce the design and ideological structures of the advertising world day after day in their professional everyday life , can turn the statement of advertising aesthetics upside ##AT##-##AT## down with just a little twist in a successful fake .
The knowledge of the &quot; language of power &quot; that is required in professional life can be turned into resistance and into subversion at any time .
For communication guerillas , this knowledge is central .
One of the reasons why the campaign against the deportation airline Lufthansa was so successful was because the form of professional self ##AT##-##AT## representation was imitated so perfectly , while the meaning was turned into its opposite through consistent exaggeration - from Lufthansa &apos;s &quot; we fly you there &quot; to the &quot; we fly you out &quot; of the Deportation Class .
For communication guerillas , it is not enough to know the adversary -- the point is to master the forms and signs that constitute &quot; the language of power &quot; , so to speak , ourselves .
Communication guerill ##AT## s are not spies or undercover agents in the working world or the world of bourgeois consensus .
In their life praxis , they are often part of it , accepting roles as teachers or colleagues , assuming functions in the capitalist system .
Yet it is precisely in this way that the oscillation between radical criticism and camouflage becomes possible .
The recipient ##AT##-##AT## journalists and their readers , potential customers , everyone confronted with the advertising material of the Deportation Class , are automatically drawn into the contradictions of the capitalist system and its western humanistic ideology : Is Deportation Class really a cynical special offer from Lufthansa for cheap seats on deportation flights ?
Or is it in fact a particularly successful criticism of their deportation practice ?
If the recipient decides on the first reading , then they are confronted with the question of whether this entails money ##AT##-##AT## making at the expense of human dignity or a legitimate marketing instrument .
If they see through the Deportation Class as a fake , then they cannot simply dismiss it as an absurd slander -- it is too close to the logic of the narration of the real Lufthansa ideology .
Regardless of which reading the recipient decides to take , once the questions are posed , they stick to Lufthansa .
In this way , soiling an image breaks open what is widely accepted and taken for granted in the capitalist system , thus opening up an unmediated view of contradictions between reality and representation .
The communication guerilla must have no fear of contact : she has to dare to completely enter into the logic of the detested dominant discourse , in order to turn it around from the inside .
And he has to trust in the effectiveness of signs , not give in to the temptation to offer explanatory information after all and thus dropping the mask .
In the course of the warring escapades of the German SPD government , which was also supported by the Greens , a poster turned up with the familiar dying soldier ( &quot; Why ?
A slight distortion turned the &quot; Why ? &quot; into &quot; Why not ? &quot; .
The logos of the SPD and the Greens at the lower edge of the poster suggested that the poster could be a publication from these parties -- although the knowledgeable reader of signs understands very well that political parties would never state the cynicism of their politics that openly .
Through the choice and montage of the images , the poster clearly said : a cynical &quot; Why not ? &quot; is the attitude of these parties , whether they admit it or not .
With the addition of a reproachful text , however , this intervention would have left the space of the communication guerilla to become propaganda / agitation .
Its function would have been an explanation with a grin factor , rather than irritation , which forces reflection in the best case .
There is no doubt about it : we are in the midst of globalization , particularly as activists .
The skills that are practiced with the protests of the often so ##AT##-##AT## called anti ##AT##-##AT## globalizers , are exactly the ones that every corporate boss would wish for in his employees : capability for teamwork in time ##AT##-##AT## limited projects together with previously unknown colleagues .
Transversality here too -- the only question is , to which end ?
If it is true that we find ourselves in the midst of a transition to the control society , then in the future it could be even more important to hone our subversive potential at the molecular level , to make it even more targeted .
In the emerging Empire , it will become even less possible for us to direct our displeasure to individual governments -- the game with images and representations will become increasingly important in the networked parts of the world , but without a decrease in the importance of vehement actions in public space .
It is a matter of a political positioning that is not limited to theoretical analysis in the terms of sociology and cultural theory , but rather which also thinks in images and knows how to use sign systems .
Fury and irritation and the desire to flip off power often lead more effectively than rational reflection to recognizing the cracks and contradictions in dominant discourse .
Yet the communication guerilla does not stand still in a self ##AT##-##AT## referential temporary confusion -- she continues to link it with argumentation in bourgeois and own media , is connected to counter ##AT##-##AT## public spheres and refers to the themes and concerns of social movements .
In recent years , these movements have taken over new technologies , from mobile phones to the use ( and faking ) of increasingly interactive web sites and videos , to live streaming .
Information technologies , useful instruments of the control society , can be subversively turned around , activists can make use of the skills they acquire in their paid work for other purposes as well .
Conversely , the ways of working that they learn in the scene world can also be useful to them in the neoliberal , flexibilized everyday world of work .
Time ##AT##-##AT## limited , project ##AT##-##AT## oriented teamwork and spatial flexibility are only two examples from many .
Particularly in a societal formation , in which signs , branding , images are increasingly important not only in the business world , but also for governments and multinational structures such as the WHO or the G8 , the communication guerilla can carry out efficient attacks .
The world of activism is not located outside the globalization process , the transition from the age of bourgeois democracies to something else , something not yet defined .
It is part of this -- and it is in the intimate knowledge of the structures to be fought that its potential to at least question their legitimacy is found -- even if the next grand narrative is yet to come .

Lehi counsels and blesses his posterity — He dies and is buried — Nephi glories in the goodness of God to him — Nephi puts his trust in the Lord forever .
1 And now , I , Nephi , speak concerning the prophecies of which my father hath spoken , concerning a Joseph , who was carried into Egypt .
2 For behold , he truly prophesied concerning all his seed .
And the a prophecies which he wrote , there are not many greater .
And he prophesied concerning us , and our future generations ; and they are written upon the b plates of brass .
3 Wherefore , after my father had made an end of speaking concerning the prophecies of Joseph , he called the children of Laman , his sons , and his daughters , and said unto them : Behold , my sons , and my daughters , who are the sons and the daughters of my a first -born , I would that ye should give ear unto my words .
4 For the Lord God hath said that : a Inasmuch as ye shall keep my commandments ye shall prosper in the land ; and inasmuch as ye will not keep my commandments ye shall be cut off from my presence .
5 But behold , my sons and my daughters , I cannot go down to my grave save I should leave a a blessing upon you ; for behold , I know that if ye are b brought up in the c way ye should go ye will not depart from it .
6 Wherefore , if ye are a cursed , behold , I leave my blessing upon you , that the b cursing may be taken from you and be answered upon the c heads of your parents .
7 Wherefore , because of my blessing the Lord God will a not suffer that ye shall perish ; wherefore , he will be b merciful unto you and unto your seed forever .
8 And it came to pass that after my father had made an end of speaking to the sons and daughters of Laman , he caused the sons and daughters of Lemuel to be brought before him .
9 And he spake unto them , saying : Behold , my sons and my daughters , who are the sons and the daughters of my second son ; behold I leave unto you the same blessing which I left unto the sons and daughters of Laman ; wherefore , thou shalt not utterly be destroyed ; but in the end thy seed shall be blessed .
10 And it came to pass that when my father had made an end of speaking unto them , behold , he spake unto the sons of a Ishmael , yea , and even all his household .
11 And after he had made an end of speaking unto them , he spake unto Sam , saying : Blessed art thou , and thy a seed ; for thou shalt inherit the land like unto thy brother Nephi .
And thy seed shall be numbered with his seed ; and thou shalt be even like unto thy brother , and thy seed like unto his seed ; and thou shalt be blessed in all thy days .
12 And it came to pass after my father , Lehi , had a spoken unto all his household , according to the feelings of his heart and the Spirit of the Lord which was in him , he waxed b old .
And it came to pass that he died , and was buried .
13 And it came to pass that not many days after his death , Laman and Lemuel and the sons of Ishmael were a angry with me because of the admonitions of the Lord .
14 For I , Nephi , was constrained to speak unto them , according to his word ; for I had spoken many things unto them , and also my father , before his death ; many of which sayings are written upon mine a other plates ; for a more history part are written upon mine other plates .
15 And upon a these I b write the things of my soul , and many of the scriptures which are engraven upon the plates of brass .
For my soul c delighteth in the scriptures , and my heart d pondereth them , and writeth them for the e learning and the profit of my children .
16 Behold , my a soul delighteth in the things of the Lord ; and my b heart pondereth continually upon the things which I have seen and heard .
17 Nevertheless , notwithstanding the great a goodness of the Lord , in showing me his great and marvelous works , my heart exclaimeth : O b wretched man that I am !
Yea , my heart c sorroweth because of my flesh ; my soul grieveth because of mine iniquities .
18 I am encompassed about , because of the temptations and the sins which do so easily a beset me .
19 And when I desire to rejoice , my heart groaneth because of my sins ; nevertheless , I know in whom I have a trusted .
20 My God hath been my a support ; he hath led me through mine b afflictions in the wilderness ; and he hath preserved me upon the waters of the great deep .
21 He hath filled me with his a love , even unto the b consuming of my flesh .
22 He hath confounded mine a enemies , unto the causing of them to quake before me .
23 Behold , he hath heard my cry by day , and he hath given me a knowledge by b visions in the night ##AT##-##AT## time .
24 And by day have I waxed bold in mighty a prayer before him ; yea , my voice have I sent up on high ; and angels came down and ministered unto me .
25 And upon the wings of his Spirit hath my body been a carried away upon exceedingly high mountains .
And mine eyes have beheld great things , yea , even too great for man ; therefore I was bidden that I should not write them .
26 O then , if I have seen so great things , if the Lord in his condescension unto the children of men hath a visited men in so much b mercy , c why should my d heart weep and my soul linger in the valley of sorrow , and my flesh waste away , and my strength slacken , because of mine afflictions ?
27 And why should I a yield to sin , because of my flesh ?
Yea , why should I give way to b temptations , that the evil one have place in my heart to destroy my c peace and afflict my soul ?
Why am I d angry because of mine enemy ?
No longer a droop in sin .
Rejoice , O my heart , and give place no more for the b enemy of my soul .
29 Do not a anger again because of mine enemies .
Do not slacken my strength because of mine afflictions .
30 Rejoice , O my a heart , and cry unto the Lord , and say : O Lord , I will praise thee forever ; yea , my soul will rejoice in thee , my God , and the b rock of my salvation .
31 O Lord , wilt thou a redeem my soul ?
Wilt thou deliver me out of the hands of mine enemies ?
Wilt thou make me that I may shake at the appearance of b sin ?
32 May the gates of hell be shut continually before me , because that my a heart is broken and my spirit is contrite !
O Lord , wilt thou not shut the gates of thy righteousness before me , that I may b walk in the path of the low valley , that I may be strict in the plain road !
33 O Lord , wilt thou encircle me around in the robe of thy a righteousness !
O Lord , wilt thou make a way for mine escape before mine b enemies !
Wilt thou make my path straight before me !
Wilt thou not place a stumbling block in my way — but that thou wouldst clear my way before me , and hedge not up my way , but the ways of mine enemy .
34 O Lord , I have a trusted in thee , and I will b trust in thee forever .
I will not put my c trust in the arm of flesh ; for I know that cursed is he that putteth his d trust in the arm of flesh .
Yea , cursed is he that putteth his trust in man or maketh flesh his arm .
35 Yea , I know that God will give a liberally to him that asketh .
Yea , my God will give me , if I b ask c not amiss ; therefore I will lift up my voice unto thee ; yea , I will cry unto thee , my God , the d rock of my e righteousness .
Behold , my voice shall forever ascend up unto thee , my rock and mine everlasting God .

Revelation given to Joseph Smith the Prophet , near Wight ’ s Ferry , at a place called Spring Hill , Daviess County , Missouri , May 19 , 1838 . HC 3 : 35 .
1 Spring Hill is named by the Lord a Adam -ondi ##AT##-##AT## Ahman , because , said he , it is the place where b Adam shall come to visit his people , or the Ancient of Days shall sit , as spoken of by Daniel the prophet .
Ordination of Joseph Smith and Oliver Cowdery to the Aaronic Priesthood along the bank of the Susquehanna River , near Harmony , Pennsylvania , May 15 , 1829 . HC 1 : 39 – 42 .
The ordination was done by the hands of an angel , who announced himself as John , the same that is called John the Baptist in the New Testament .
The angel explained that he was acting under the direction of Peter , James , and John , the ancient apostles , who held the keys of the higher priesthood , which was called the Priesthood of Melchizedek .
The promise was given to Joseph and Oliver that in due time the Priesthood of Melchizedek would be conferred upon them .
Keys and powers of Aaronic Priesthood are set forth .
1 Upon you my fellow servants , in the name of Messiah I a confer the b Priesthood of Aaron , which holds the c keys of the ministering of d angels , and of the gospel of e repentance , and of f baptism by immersion for the remission of sins ; and this shall never be taken again from the earth , until the sons of g Levi do offer again an offering unto the Lord in h righteousness .
Items of instruction given by Joseph Smith the Prophet , at Ramus , Illinois , April 2 , 1843 . HC 5 : 323 – 325 .
1 When the Savior shall a appear we shall see him as he is .
We shall see that he is a b man like ourselves .
2 And that same a sociality which exists among us here will exist among us there , only it will be coupled with b eternal glory , which glory we do not now enjoy .
3 John 14 : 23 — The a appearing of the Father and the Son , in that verse , is a personal b appearance ; and the idea that the Father and the Son c dwell in a man ’ s heart is an old sectarian notion , and is false .
4 In answer to the question — Is not the reckoning of God ’ s a time , angel ’ s time , prophet ’ s time , and man ’ s time , according to the planet on which they reside ?
But there are no a angels who b minister to this earth but those who do belong or have belonged to it .
7 But a they reside in the b presence of God , on a globe c like a d sea of glass and e fire , where all things for their glory are manifest , past , present , and future , and are continually before the Lord .
8 The place where God resides is a great a Urim and Thummim .
9 This a earth , in its b sanctified and c immortal state , will be made like unto d crystal and will be a Urim and Thummim to the inhabitants who dwell thereon , whereby all things pertaining to an inferior kingdom , or all kingdoms of a lower order , will be manifest to those who dwell on it ; and this earth will be e Christ ’ s .
11 And a a white stone is given to each of those who come into the celestial kingdom , whereon is a new b name written , which no man knoweth save he that receiveth it .
The new name is the key word .
12 I prophesy , in the name of the Lord God , that the commencement of the a difficulties which will cause much bloodshed previous to the coming of the Son of Man will be in South Carolina .
13 It may probably arise through the slave question .
This a a voice declared to me , while I was praying earnestly on the subject , December 25th , 1832 .
15 Joseph , my son , if thou livest until thou art eighty ##AT##-##AT## five years old , thou shalt see the face of the Son of Man ; therefore a let this suffice , and trouble me no more on this matter .
16 I was left thus , without being able to decide whether this coming referred to the beginning of the millennium or to some previous appearing , or whether I should die and thus see his face .
17 I believe the coming of the Son of Man will not be any sooner than that time .
18 Whatever principle of a intelligence we attain unto in this life , it will rise with us in the b resurrection .
19 And if a person gains more a knowledge and intelligence in this life through his b diligence and obedience than another , he will have so much the c advantage in the world to come .
21 And when we obtain any a blessing from God , it is by b obedience to that law upon which it is predicated .
22 The a Father has a b body of flesh and bones as tangible as man ’ s ; the Son also ; but the Holy Ghost has not a body of flesh and bones , but is a personage of c Spirit .
Were it not so , the Holy Ghost could not d dwell in us .
23 A man may receive the a Holy Ghost , and it may descend upon him and not b tarry with him .
Revelation given through Joseph Smith the Prophet , at Nauvoo , Illinois , recorded July 12 , 1843 , relating to the new and everlasting covenant , including the eternity of the marriage covenant , as also plurality of wives . HC 5 : 501 – 507 .
Although the revelation was recorded in 1843 , it is evident from the historical records that the doctrines and principles involved in this revelation had been known by the Prophet since 1831 .
2 Behold , and lo , I am the Lord thy God , and will answer thee as touching this matter .
3 Therefore , a prepare thy heart to receive and b obey the instructions which I am about to give unto you ; for all those who have this law revealed unto them must obey the same .
4 For behold , I reveal unto you a new and an everlasting a covenant ; and if ye abide not that covenant , then are ye b damned ; for no one can c reject this covenant and be permitted to enter into my glory .
5 For all who will have a a blessing at my hands shall abide the b law which was appointed for that blessing , and the conditions thereof , as were instituted from before the foundation of the world .
6 And as pertaining to the new and a everlasting covenant , it was instituted for the fulness of my b glory ; and he that receiveth a fulness thereof must and shall abide the law , or he shall be damned , saith the Lord God .
8 Behold , mine house is a house of a order , saith the Lord God , and not a house of confusion .
9 Will I a accept of an offering , saith the Lord , that is not made in my name ?
10 Or will I receive at your hands that which I have not a appointed ?
11 And will I appoint unto you , saith the Lord , except it be by law , even as I and my Father a ordained unto you , before the world was ?
12 I am the Lord thy God ; and I give unto you this commandment — that no man shall a come unto the Father but by me or by my word , which is my law , saith the Lord .
13 And everything that is in the world , whether it be ordained of men , by a thrones , or principalities , or powers , or things of name , whatsoever they may be , that are not by me or by my word , saith the Lord , shall be thrown down , and shall b not remain after men are dead , neither in nor after the resurrection , saith the Lord your God .
14 For whatsoever things remain are by me ; and whatsoever things are not by me shall be shaken and destroyed .
15 Therefore , if a a man marry him a wife in the world , and he marry her not by me nor by my word , and he covenant with her so long as he is in the world and she with him , their covenant and marriage are not of force when they are dead , and when they are out of the world ; therefore , they are not bound by any law when they are out of the world .
16 Therefore , when they are out of the world they neither marry nor are given in a marriage ; but are appointed angels in b heaven , which angels are ministering c servants , to minister for those who are worthy of a far more , and an exceeding , and an eternal weight of glory .
17 For these angels did not abide my law ; therefore , they cannot be enlarged , but remain separately and singly , without exaltation , in their saved condition , to all eternity ; and from henceforth are not gods , but are a angels of God forever and ever .
20 Then shall they be gods , because they have no end ; therefore shall they be from a everlasting to everlasting , because they continue ; then shall they be above all , because all things are subject unto them .
Then shall they be b gods , because they have c all power , and the angels are subject unto them .
21 Verily , verily , I say unto you , except ye abide my a law ye cannot attain to this glory .
22 For a strait is the gate , and narrow the b way that leadeth unto the exaltation and continuation of the c lives , and few there be that find it , because ye receive me not in the world neither do ye know me .
23 But if ye receive me in the world , then shall ye know me , and shall receive your exaltation ; that a where I am ye shall be also .
24 This is a eternal lives — to b know the only wise and true God , and Jesus Christ , whom he hath c sent .
25 a Broad is the gate , and wide the way that leadeth to the b deaths ; and many there are that go in thereat , because they c receive me not , neither do they abide in my law .
27 The a blasphemy against the Holy Ghost , which shall b not be c forgiven in the world nor out of the world , is in that ye commit d murder wherein ye shed innocent blood , and assent unto my death , after ye have received my new and everlasting covenant , saith the Lord God ; and he that abideth not this law can in nowise enter into my glory , but shall be e damned , saith the Lord .
28 I am the Lord thy God , and will give unto thee the a law of my Holy Priesthood , as was ordained by me and my Father before the world was .
29 a Abraham received all things , whatsoever he received , by revelation and commandment , by my word , saith the Lord , and hath entered into his exaltation and sitteth upon his throne .
30 a Abraham received promises concerning his seed , and of the fruit of his loins — from whose b loins ye are , namely , my servant Joseph — which were to continue so long as they were in the world ; and as touching Abraham and his seed , out of the world they should continue ; both in the world and out of the world should they continue as innumerable as the c stars ; or , if ye were to count the sand upon the seashore ye could not number them .
31 This promise is yours also , because ye are of a Abraham , and the promise was made unto Abraham ; and by this law is the continuation of the works of my Father , wherein he glorifieth himself .
32 Go ye , therefore , and do the a works of Abraham ; enter ye into my law and ye shall be saved .
33 But if ye enter not into my law ye cannot receive the promise of my Father , which he made unto Abraham .
34 God a commanded Abraham , and Sarah gave b Hagar to Abraham to wife .
Because this was the law ; and from Hagar sprang many people .
Verily I say unto you , Nay ; for I , the Lord , a commanded it .
36 Abraham was a commanded to offer his son Isaac ; nevertheless , it was written : Thou shalt not b kill .
Abraham , however , did not refuse , and it was accounted unto him for c righteousness .
37 Abraham received a concubines , and they bore him children ; and it was accounted unto him for righteousness , because they were given unto him , and he abode in my law ; as Isaac also and b Jacob did none other things than that which they were commanded ; and because they did none other things than that which they were commanded , they have entered into their c exaltation , according to the promises , and sit upon thrones , and are not angels but are gods .
38 David also received a many wives and concubines , and also Solomon and Moses my servants , as also many others of my servants , from the beginning of creation until this time ; and in nothing did they sin save in those things which they received not of me .
40 I am the Lord thy God , and I gave unto thee , my servant Joseph , an a appointment , and restore all things .
Ask what ye will , and it shall be given unto you according to my word .
41 And as ye have asked concerning adultery , verily , verily , I say unto you , if a man a receiveth a wife in the new and everlasting covenant , and if she be with another man , and I have not appointed unto her by the holy b anointing , she hath committed c adultery and shall be destroyed .
42 If she be not in the new and everlasting covenant , and she be with another man , she has a committed adultery .
43 And if her husband be with another woman , and he was under a a vow , he hath broken his vow and hath committed adultery .
44 And if she hath not committed adultery , but is innocent and hath not broken her vow , and she knoweth it , and I reveal it unto you , my servant Joseph , then shall you have power , by the power of my Holy Priesthood , to take her and a give her unto him that hath not committed b adultery but hath been c faithful ; for he shall be made ruler over many .
45 For I have conferred upon you the a keys and power of the priesthood , wherein I b restore all things , and make known unto you all things in due time .
46 And verily , verily , I say unto you , that whatsoever you a seal on earth shall be sealed in heaven ; and whatsoever you b bind on earth , in my name and by my word , saith the Lord , it shall be eternally bound in the heavens ; and whosesoever sins you c remit on earth shall be remitted eternally in the heavens ; and whosesoever sins you retain on earth shall be retained in heaven .
47 And again , verily I say , whomsoever you bless I will bless , and whomsoever you curse I will a curse , saith the Lord ; for I , the Lord , am thy God .
48 And again , verily I say unto you , my servant Joseph , that whatsoever you give on earth , and to whomsoever you a give any one on earth , by my word and according to my law , it shall be visited with blessings and not cursings , and with my power , saith the Lord , and shall be without condemnation on earth and in heaven .
49 For I am the Lord thy God , and will be a with thee even unto the b end of the world , and through all eternity ; for verily I c seal upon you your d exaltation , and prepare a throne for you in the kingdom of my Father , with Abraham your e father .
50 Behold , I have seen your a sacrifices , and will forgive all your sins ; I have seen your b sacrifices in obedience to that which I have told you .
Go , therefore , and I make a way for your escape , as I c accepted the offering of Abraham of his son Isaac .
51 Verily , I say unto you : A commandment I give unto mine handmaid , Emma Smith , your wife , whom I have given unto you , that she stay herself and partake not of that which I commanded you to offer unto her ; for I did it , saith the Lord , to a prove you all , as I did Abraham , and that I might require an offering at your hand , by covenant and sacrifice .
52 And let mine handmaid , Emma Smith , a receive all those that have been given unto my servant Joseph , and who are virtuous and pure before me ; and those who are not pure , and have said they were pure , shall be destroyed , saith the Lord God .
53 For I am the Lord thy God , and ye shall obey my voice ; and I give unto my servant Joseph that he shall be made ruler over many things ; for he hath been a faithful over a few things , and from henceforth I will strengthen him .
54 And I command mine handmaid , Emma Smith , to abide and a cleave unto my servant Joseph , and to none else .
But if she will not abide this commandment she shall be b destroyed , saith the Lord ; for I am the Lord thy God , and will destroy her if she abide not in my law .
55 But if she will not abide this commandment , then shall my servant Joseph do all things for her , even as he hath said ; and I will bless him and multiply him and give unto him an a hundredfold in this world , of fathers and mothers , brothers and sisters , houses and lands , wives and children , and crowns of b eternal lives in the eternal worlds .
56 And again , verily I say , let mine handmaid a forgive my servant Joseph his trespasses ; and then shall she be forgiven her trespasses , wherein she has trespassed against me ; and I , the Lord thy God , will bless her , and multiply her , and make her heart to b rejoice .
57 And again , I say , let not my servant Joseph put his property out of his hands , lest an enemy come and destroy him ; for a Satan b seeketh to destroy ; for I am the Lord thy God , and he is my servant ; and behold , and lo , I am with him , as I was with Abraham , thy father , even unto his c exaltation and glory .
58 Now , as touching the law of the a priesthood , there are many things pertaining thereunto .
59 Verily , if a man be called of my Father , as was a Aaron , by mine own voice , and by the voice of him that b sent me , and I have endowed him with the c keys of the power of this priesthood , if he do anything in my name , and according to my law and by my word , he will not commit d sin , and I will justify him .
60 Let no one , therefore , set on my servant Joseph ; for I will justify him ; for he shall do the sacrifice which I require at his hands for his transgressions , saith the Lord your God .
61 And again , as pertaining to the law of the priesthood — if any man espouse a virgin , and desire to espouse a another , and the first give her consent , and if he espouse the second , and they are virgins , and have vowed to no other man , then is he justified ; he cannot commit adultery for they are given unto him ; for he cannot commit adultery with that that belongeth unto him and to no one else .
62 And if he have a ten virgins given unto him by this law , he cannot commit adultery , for they belong to him , and they are given unto him ; therefore is he justified .
64 And again , verily , verily , I say unto you , if any man have a wife , who holds the keys of this power , and he teaches unto her the law of my priesthood , as pertaining to these things , then shall she believe and administer unto him , or she shall be destroyed , saith the Lord your God ; for I will destroy her ; for I will magnify my name upon all those who receive and abide in my law .
65 Therefore , it shall be lawful in me , if she receive not this law , for him to receive all things whatsoever I , the Lord his God , will give unto him , because she did not believe and administer unto him according to my word ; and she then becomes the transgressor ; and he is exempt from the law of Sarah , who administered unto Abraham according to the law when I commanded Abraham to take a Hagar to wife .
66 And now , as pertaining to this law , verily , verily , I say unto you , I will reveal more unto you , hereafter ; therefore , let this suffice for the present .
Revelation on Church Organization and Government , given through Joseph Smith the Prophet , April 1830 . HC 1 : 64 – 70 .
4 And this according to the a grace of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ , to whom be all glory , both now and forever .
12 Thereby showing that he is the a same God yesterday , today , and b forever .
13 Therefore , having so great witnesses , by a them shall the world be judged , even as many as shall hereafter come to a knowledge of this work .
16 For the Lord God has spoken it ; and we , the elders of the church , have heard and bear a witness to the words of the glorious Majesty on high , to whom be glory forever and ever .
19 And gave unto them commandments that they should a love and b serve him , the only c living and true d God , and that he should be the only being whom they should worship .
20 But by the a transgression of these holy laws man became b sensual and c devilish , and became d fallen man .
21 Wherefore , the Almighty God gave his a Only Begotten Son , as it is written in those scriptures which have been given of him .
22 He a suffered b temptations but gave no heed unto them .
28 Which Father , Son , and Holy Ghost are a one God , infinite and eternal , without end .
29 And we know that all men must a repent and b believe on the name of Jesus Christ , and worship the Father in his name , and c endure in d faith on his name to the end , or they cannot be e saved in the kingdom of God .
31 And we know also , that a sanctification through the grace of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ is just and true , to all those who b love and serve God with all their c mights , minds , and strength .
34 Yea , and even let those who are a sanctified take heed also .
35 And we know that these things are true and according to the revelations of John , neither a adding to , nor diminishing from the prophecy of his book , the holy scriptures , or the revelations of God which shall come hereafter by the gift and power of the Holy Ghost , the b voice of God , or the ministering of angels .
36 And the Lord God has a spoken it ; and honor , power and glory be rendered to his holy b name , both now and ever .
44 And to take the a lead of all meetings .
45 The elders are to a conduct the b meetings as they are c led by the Holy Ghost , according to the commandments and revelations of God .
47 And visit the house of each member , and exhort them to a pray b vocally and in secret and attend to all c family duties .
48 And he may also a ordain other priests , teachers , and deacons .
51 And visit the house of each member , exhorting them to pray vocally and in secret and attend to all family duties .
52 In all these duties the priest is to a assist the elder if occasion requires .
55 And see that the church meet together often , and also see that all the members do their duty .
57 And is to be assisted always , in all his duties in the church , by the a deacons , if occasion requires .
59 They are , however , to warn , expound , exhort , and teach , and invite all to come unto Christ .
60 Every a elder , b priest , teacher , or deacon is to be c ordained d according to the gifts and callings of God unto him ; and he is to be e ordained by the power of the Holy Ghost , which is in the one who ordains him .
62 And said conferences are to do whatever church business is necessary to be done at the time .
63 The elders are to receive their licenses from other elders , by a vote of the church to which they belong , or from the conferences .
64 Each priest , teacher , or deacon , who is ordained by a priest , may take a certificate from him at the time , which a certificate , when presented to an elder , shall entitle him to a license , which shall authorize him to perform the duties of his calling , or he may receive it from a conference .
66 But the presiding elders , traveling bishops , high councilors , high priests , and elders , may have the privilege of ordaining , where there is no branch of the church that a vote may be called .
67 Every president of the high priesthood ( or presiding elder ) , a bishop , high councilor , and b high priest , is to be ordained by the direction of a c high council or general conference .
68 The a duty of the members after they are received by b baptism . — The elders or priests are to have a sufficient time to expound all things concerning the church of Christ to their c understanding , previous to their partaking of the d sacrament and being confirmed by the laying on of the e hands of the elders , so that all things may be done in f order .
69 And the members shall manifest before the church , and also before the elders , by a a godly walk and conversation , that they are worthy of it , that there may be works and b faith agreeable to the holy scriptures — walking in c holiness before the Lord .
70 Every member of the church of Christ having a children is to bring them unto the elders before the church , who are to lay their b hands upon them in the name of Jesus Christ , and bless them in his name .
71 No one can be received into the church of Christ unless he has arrived unto the years of a accountability before God , and is capable of b repentance .
73 The person who is called of God and has authority from Jesus Christ to baptize , shall go down into the water with the person who has presented himself or herself for baptism , and shall say , calling him or her by name : Having been commissioned of Jesus Christ , I baptize you in the name of the Father , and of the Son , and of the Holy Ghost .
74 Then shall he a immerse him or her in the water , and come forth again out of the water .
79 O God , the Eternal Father , we ask thee in the name of thy Son , Jesus Christ , to bless and sanctify this a wine to the souls of all those who drink of it , that they may do it in remembrance of the blood of thy Son , which was shed for them ; that they may witness unto thee , O God , the Eternal Father , that they do always remember him , that they may have his Spirit to be with them .
80 Any member of the church of Christ a transgressing , or being b overtaken in a fault , shall be dealt with as the scriptures direct .
83 And also , if any have been a expelled from the church , so that their names may be blotted out of the general church b record of names .
84 All members removing from the church where they reside , if going to a church where they are not known , may take a letter a certifying that they are regular members and in good standing , which certificate may be signed by any elder or priest if the member receiving the letter is personally acquainted with the elder or priest , or it may be signed by the teachers or deacons of the church .
How the elders and priests administer the sacramental bread .
2 Wherefore , in my days , I would that ye should know that I fought much with the sword to preserve my people , the Nephites , from falling into the hands of their enemies , the Lamanites .
But behold , I of myself a am a wicked man , and I have not kept the statutes and the commandments of the Lord as I ought to have done .
3 And it came to pass that ##STAR## two hundred and seventy and six years had passed away , and we had many seasons of peace ; and we had many a seasons of serious war and bloodshed .
Yea , and in fine , ##STAR## two hundred and eighty and two years had passed away , and I had kept these plates according to the b commandments of my c fathers ; and I d conferred them upon my son Amaron .
4 And now I , Amaron , write the things whatsoever I write , which are few , in the book of my father .
5 Behold , it came to pass that ##STAR## three hundred and twenty years had passed away , and the more wicked part of the Nephites were a destroyed .
6 For the Lord would not suffer , after he had led them out of the land of Jerusalem and kept and preserved them from falling into the hands of their enemies , yea , he would not suffer that the words should not be verified , which he spake unto our fathers , saying that : a Inasmuch as ye will not keep my commandments ye shall not b prosper in the land .
7 Wherefore , the Lord did visit them in great judgment ; nevertheless , he did spare the righteous that they should not perish , but did deliver them out of the hands of their enemies .
8 And it came to pass that I did deliver the plates unto my brother Chemish .
9 Now I , Chemish , write what few things I write , in the same book with my brother ; for behold , I saw the last which he wrote , that he wrote it with his own hand ; and he wrote it in the day that he delivered them unto me .
And after this manner we keep the a records , for it is according to the commandments of our fathers .
10 Behold , I , Abinadom , am the son of Chemish .
Behold , it came to pass that I saw much war and contention between my people , the Nephites , and the Lamanites ; and I , with my own sword , have taken the lives of many of the Lamanites in the defence of my brethren .
11 And behold , the a record of this people is engraven upon plates which is had by the b kings , according to the generations ; and I know of no revelation save that which has been written , neither prophecy ; wherefore , that which is sufficient is written .
12 Behold , I am Amaleki , the son of Abinadom .
13 And it came to pass that he did according as the Lord had commanded him .
And they departed out of the land into the wilderness , as many as would hearken unto the voice of the Lord ; and they were led by many preachings and prophesyings .
And they were admonished continually by the word of God ; and they were led by the power of his a arm , through the wilderness until they came down into the land which is called the b land of Zarahemla .
14 And they discovered a a people , who were called the people of Zarahemla .
Now , there was great rejoicing among the people of Zarahemla ; and also Zarahemla did rejoice exceedingly , because the Lord had sent the people of Mosiah with the b plates of brass which contained the record of the Jews .
15 Behold , it came to pass that Mosiah discovered that the people of a Zarahemla came out from Jerusalem at the time that b Zedekiah , king of Judah , was carried away captive into Babylon .
16 And they a journeyed in the wilderness , and were brought by the hand of the Lord across the great waters , into the land where Mosiah discovered them ; and they had dwelt there from that time forth .
17 And at the time that Mosiah discovered them , they had become exceedingly numerous .
Nevertheless , they had had many wars and serious contentions , and had fallen by the sword from time to time ; and their a language had become corrupted ; and they had brought no b records with them ; and they denied the being of their Creator ; and Mosiah , nor the people of Mosiah , could understand them .
18 But it came to pass that Mosiah caused that they should be taught in his a language .
And it came to pass that after they were taught in the language of Mosiah , Zarahemla gave a genealogy of his fathers , according to his memory ; and they are written , but b not in these plates .
19 And it came to pass that the people of Zarahemla , and of Mosiah , did a unite together ; and b Mosiah was appointed to be their king .
20 And it came to pass in the days of Mosiah , there was a large a stone brought unto him with engravings on it ; and he did b interpret the engravings by the gift and power of God .
21 And they gave an account of one a Coriantumr , and the slain of his people .
And Coriantumr was discovered by the people of Zarahemla ; and he dwelt with them for the space of nine moons .
22 It also spake a few words concerning his fathers .
And his first parents came out from the a tower , at the time the Lord b confounded the language of the people ; and the severity of the Lord fell upon them according to his judgments , which are just ; and their c bones lay scattered in the land northward .
23 Behold , I , Amaleki , was born in the days of Mosiah ; and I have lived to see his death ; and a Benjamin , b his son , reigneth in his stead .
24 And behold , I have seen , in the days of king Benjamin , a serious war and much bloodshed between the Nephites and the Lamanites .
But behold , the Nephites did obtain much advantage over them ; yea , insomuch that king Benjamin did drive them out of the land of Zarahemla .
26 And now , my beloved brethren , I would that ye should a come unto Christ , who is the Holy One of Israel , and partake of his salvation , and the power of his redemption .
Yea , come unto him , and b offer your whole souls as an c offering unto him , and continue in d fasting and praying , and endure to the end ; and as the Lord liveth ye will be saved .
27 And now I would speak somewhat concerning a certain a number who went up into the wilderness to b return to the c land of Nephi ; for there was a large number who were desirous to possess the land of their inheritance .
28 Wherefore , they went up into the wilderness .
And their leader being a strong and mighty man , and a stiffnecked man , wherefore he caused a contention among them ; and they were a all slain , save fifty , in the wilderness , and they returned again to the land of Zarahemla .
29 And it came to pass that they also took others to a considerable number , and took their journey again into the wilderness .
30 And I , Amaleki , had a brother , who also went with them ; and I have not since known concerning them .
And I am about to lie down in my grave ; and a these plates are full .
And I make an end of my speaking .

The primary goal of BlogTalk conference is to inventory the current and emerging uses of blogs .
The mission of BlogTalk is to survey the status quo of Weblogs or Blogs as tools for professional and private use .
It is likewise an issue to think about blogging from different devices particularily from mobile devices such as cellphones or PDAs .
In addition we will talk about future applicatons and uses within a business or educational context .
Talking about usage for private use will lead to considerations about Blog services and business models on the one side and on more phenomenological and social issues on the individual side .
Blogs are from a technological perspective micro ##AT##-##AT## content ##AT##-##AT## management systems that separate the content from the layout .
In general they are based on databases , template and scripts .
Blog ##AT##-##AT## software is available for different operating systems like Linux , Windows , Mac .
Blogs are ideally deployed in the fields of public relations , marketing , product development , knowledge ##AT##-##AT## management , project ##AT##-##AT## management , reporting , research , and of course journalism .
They are further ideal tools for personal private publishing .
Another goal of BlogTalk is to bring together active bloggers from all over the world as well all those people from the business world and else who havn &apos;t heard the word Weblog or Blog before .
We think we are at a historical tipping point .
There are lots of Weblogs already around but only the tip of the iceberg is visible .
The goal of the conference is to boost the awareness of Blogs as proper means for diverse modes for personal and collaborative publishing .

There are currently 2 clubs in Tarifa .
The windsurfing scene has had an undeniable influence on Tarifa .
You &apos;ll find many &quot; Surf Bars &quot; playing the latest action videos and most of the surfers you see on the beach by day have made these bars their second homes at night .
Despite all that , Tarifa has lost none of its typically Spanish charm , which makes it different to the other tourist areas in southern Spain .
The standard price for a drink is about € 3 , going up to € 6 in some bars .
A typical night in Tarifa starts with a drink or coffee in the central places Café Central ( Terrace , pop music ) or Misiana / Metamorfosis ( house ) , or in one of the &quot; early &quot; bars as Tribu : Pizza , drinks , surfers video , and evidently many surfers ; Tejota : very small , very good prices , very German ; Cocktails : as the name implies , more than 200 cocktails , O &apos;Bajano : plenty of cocktails and French people around .
All of these small &quot; very worth a visit &quot; bars are around the &quot; Calle de la Luz &quot; the one going up from Misiana to the Puerta de Jerez .
Later on , the party gets started in the disco bars .
Younger tourists start with Transito and if you return a few years later they ’ ll let you in Pasaje where they play mainly house music .
Go to Soul Café with Agu who is by far best DJ in town , or to Ruina ( also house music ) .
All of these bars have the disadvantage of being excessively expensive with drinks : from 5 to € 6 .
The Pepe &apos;s , Moscito plays a good mix of music and Pepepotamos plays mainstream pop , but they have the same disadvantage in terms of expense having had trouble to change prices from Pesetas to Euros ( prices have almost doubled in 2 years ) .
By far the more reasonably priced drinks with commercial music in Arde Tarifa , Totem , El Cateto , Geronimo , and in many of the less trendy but nevertheless good bars in Tarifa .

canonical URI : About the canonical URI of a page .
( permalink ) is the canonical URI of this page .
A resource sometimes can be reached via several URIs .
Since there might be at most one canonical URI for a resource , the mapping between a canonical URI and its resource is 1 ##AT##-##AT## to ##AT##-##AT## 1 ( given that the resource has a canonical URI at all ) .
The maintainer of the resource will usually be at pains to ensure the permanent connection between the canonical URI and the resource , while other URIs , that might have lead to the resource “ by coincidence ” at certain points in time might become invalid at any time .
( Due to the state of today &apos;s technology and the limits of human endeavor , even the validity of the canonical can not be guaranteed absolutely and for ever .
After a move of a resource the maintainer of the canonical will re ##AT##-##AT## adjust the canonical URI , if possible , while all other URIs might become invalid , so that the resource can not be reached by following them anymore .
The canonical URI is the “ official ” URI of a resource and as permanent as possible .
For links and bookmarks referring to a resource , only its canonical resource should be used .
Due to technical or organizational reasons , the URI of delivery might have to change .
This will break all previous URIs of delivery , so all links to a resource using the previous URIs of delivery will become unusable .
Thus , one understands that it is not recommended to use a URI of delivery as the canonical URI of a resource .
, no modification to these links is necessary . Search ##AT##-##AT## engines that correctly interpret the HTTP status code will index the PURL and not the URI of delivery .

Mandriva Linux 2008 Spring marks ten years of Mandriva Linux , the leader in innovative and easy ##AT##-##AT## to ##AT##-##AT## use desktop Linux .
In this release , we have integrated the most up ##AT##-##AT## to ##AT##-##AT## date versions of the major components , with the brand new GNOME 2.22 desktop , the latest stable KDE 3.5.9 ( and available 4.0.3 ) , Compiz Fusion 0.7.2 , OpenOffice.org 2.4.0 , the latest Mozilla Firefox 2.0 and Mozilla Thunderbird 2.0 .
Mandriva Linux 2008 Spring includes an all ##AT##-##AT## new base system built on version 2.6.24.4 of the Linux kernel , with the best hardware support ever in a Mandriva Linux release .
2008 Spring automatically runs on a wide range of hardware configurations , automatically detected and configured out of the box by the Mandriva tools .
You can download Mandriva Linux 2008 Spring One or download Mandriva Linux 2008 Spring Free , or buy the boxed , download or subscription Powerpack commercial edition from the Mandriva Store .
Mandriva Linux 2008 Spring includes the final release of KDE 3 , KDE 3.5.9 , as its default desktop environment .
This release brings the most successful free software desktop environment series ever to a close with many useful bug fixes , particularly to the kdepim suite , including import fixes for IMAP account handling and mail filtering , background emails filtering , improved korganizer calendar abilities .
Mandriva ##AT##-##AT## specific improvements have also been included , such as the ability to switch dynamically between standard flat menu layout and Kickoff , time based wallpapers and Metabar for easy access to files information and tasks .
KMyMoney replaces GNUcash as the default personal finance application .
The new KDE 4 series is not yet considered quite complete and bug ##AT##-##AT## free enough to become the default desktop for Mandriva Linux 2008 Spring : it will make its debut as the default environment in Mandriva Linux 2009 later this year .
However , this revolutionary and impressive new desktop will still be available to Mandriva Linux 2008 Spring users as an optional extra .
A full set of KDE 4.0.3 packages will be available in the / contrib repository for Mandriva Linux 2008 Spring , and the entire desktop can be installed simply by installing the task ##AT##-##AT## kde4 package .
KDE 4 then becomes available as a choice of desktop from the login screen .
KDE 4 overhauls many fundamental KDE components and introduces several entirely new ones , including the Phonon multimedia framework .
The Plasma desktop shell offers a new desktop interface , including panel , menu and widgets on the desktop as well as a dashboard function .
KWin , the KDE Window manager , now supports advanced graphical effects to ease interaction with your windows .
Existing KDE applications have been revised and improved , and new ones introduced , like the Okular document viewer and Dolphin file manager .
A huge amount of new artwork has been introduced throughout the desktop .
Of course , Mandriva isn &apos;t just a KDE distribution .
For those who prefer GNOME , 2008 Spring includes the freshest release , GNOME 2.22 .
Major revamp to GNOME &apos;s underlying infrastructure : the old GnomeVFS virtual filesystem is replaced with the new gvfs system .
Major improvements have been made to GNOME &apos;s Bluetooth module , improving the interface and adding several new features so you can now interact with Bluetooth devices in many ways from this single point .
Metacity , the GNOME window manager , now has optional compositing support , enabling some advanced graphical effects such as dynamic drop ##AT##-##AT## shadows on windows and a live view in the task switcher .
This feature will not be enabled by default in 2008 Spring as pre ##AT##-##AT## release testing indicated it caused problems in several situations , but it can easily be enabled by changing a single Metacity gconf setting .
Totem , GNOME &apos;s media player , now has full support for DVB digital television and is used as default video player plugin in Firefox .
Three new applications are also introduced to Mandriva &apos;s default GNOME desktop .
The Transmission client handles BitTorrent files with a simple , easy ##AT##-##AT## to ##AT##-##AT## use interface , fitting in well with the GNOME ethos .
The Brasero CD / DVD writing application provides more advanced functionality than Nautilus &apos;s ultra ##AT##-##AT## convenient but simple built ##AT##-##AT## in CD / DVD writing capabilities .
HomeBank replaces GNUCash as the default personal finance application .
Mandriva isn &apos;t even just a KDE and GNOME distribution !
Thanks once more to the work of the Mandriva Xfce development community , the full , latest version of the popular alternative desktop Xfce is available for 2008 Spring , seamlessly integrated into the Mandriva environment : an Xfce version of Mandriva &apos;s Ia Ora theme is used by default , and the standard Mandriva links and desktop launchers are included in the Xfce environment .
As with KDE 4 , Xfce 4.4.2 can be installed simply by enabling the / contrib repository and installing the task ##AT##-##AT## xfce package .
Of course , beyond even KDE , GNOME and Xfce , Mandriva provides a huge range of desktop environments and window managers with Mandriva customizations , including IceWM , Fluxbox , EDE and more .
Whatever your system &apos;s capabilities or your preferred type of desktop , Mandriva Linux 2008 Spring will have an option for you .
2008 Spring is the first Mandriva Linux release to feature the PulseAudio sound infrastructure by default .
If all you want is hassle ##AT##-##AT## free working sound on your system , PulseAudio has you covered : it makes the sound experience on Mandriva easier than ever , with more applications than ever before able to play audio together .
PulseAudio also provides some advanced features that make it a boon for many users .
Those with multiple sound devices - an increasingly common situation these days , with many USB audio devices available - will appreciate PulseAudio &apos;s ability to move sound streams from one device to another - even on ##AT##-##AT## the ##AT##-##AT## fly .
It &apos;s also easy to designate a single device as the default and have all applications respect this - something that was difficult without PulseAudio .
PulseAudio can even ( with a little extra configuration , necessary for security reasons ) let you use a sound device in another machine - you can start playing a song on your desktop , and then move the playback over the network to the sound card in your living room computer , all without the music even pausing .
Mandriva &apos;s development community has worked extensively to ensure the PulseAudio experience on 2008 Spring is as bug ##AT##-##AT## free as possible .
2008 Spring includes the latest version of the Linux kernel , 2.6.24 , with notable Mandriva patches including ALSA 1.0.16 and several other updated or additional drivers for various types of hardware .
This ensures Mandriva Linux 2008 Spring will be compatible with the widest possible range of hardware .
OpenOffice.org 2.4 comes with improved integration to the desktop and packaging .
Now the different OpenOffice.org components are separated in several packages .
Compiz 0.7 : important bugfixes , standards compliance improvements , support for multiple displays , native KDE 4 window decorator , session management support .
We at Mandriva noticed Asus &apos;s excellent Eee PC low ##AT##-##AT## cost , miniature notebook taking the world by storm .
Thanks to our work on the Intel Classmate PC , we already had extensive experience of working with this type of system , and it was simple to make Mandriva Linux 2008 Spring 100 % Eee ##AT##-##AT## friendly .
The Eee comes with a capable Linux distribution , but should you reach its limitations or prefer to install your favourite distribution instead , Mandriva Linux 2008 Spring is ready .
It supports all the Eee 700 / 701 &apos;s hardware out of the box , with no configuration required , and the Mandriva configuration tools and applications have been tweaked to be friendly to the Eee &apos;s lower resolution screen .
We have also reduced power consumption to allow longer use on battery by dynamically handling processor frequency and adding a keyboard shortcut ( fn + f6 ) to enable or disable the webcam .
Support for newer Eee models like the 900 and 901 is being added in post ##AT##-##AT## release updates , so if you have one of these systems , remember to install all available updates and reboot immediately after installing Mandriva .
It &apos;s easy to install Mandriva even without a CD or DVD drive : you can read about several possible methods right here on the Wiki .
For lots of great information and advice on installing and using Mandriva Linux 2008 Spring on various Eee PC models , visit EeeUser : particularly , the FAQ and the HOWTOs .
EeeUser also has a forum dedicated to Mandriva Linux .
Want to use an external monitor and the internal monitor of the Eee in a multi ##AT##-##AT## screen configuration ? Read this page .
Mandriva Linux 2008 Spring features much improved support for mobile device synchronization .
All major synchronization tools , frameworks and front ends are packaged and integrated so that you can synchronize Windows Mobile 5 and 6 , Blackberry and many Nokia devices with KDE or GNOME simply and easily .
See this page for detailed information and instructions on how to synchronize your mobile devices with Mandriva Linux 2008 Spring .
The Mandriva installers - both the traditional installer used by the Free and Powerpack editions , and the One live installer - can now detect other Linux distributions installed on your system and add them to the boot menu , just as they have been able to do with Windows for many years .
Now you can install Mandriva Linux on a system along with other popular Linux distributions and it will set up a boot menu so you can boot to any of them .
The Mandriva software management tools have undergone extensive improvements for Mandriva Linux 2008 Spring .
Most significantly , an entirely new system of managing information about the packages in the Mandriva repositories improves your ability to access this information .
Extended information about packages has been split into several separate extra information files for each repository , and the package management tools now have the ability to download this extra information on demand .
This means that it is easy and quick to initially configure a repository , but all the extra information you might need about a package is still available : the package management tools will just download it as needed . For instance , if you are looking through packages in the graphical software management tool and click on the changelog entry for a package , the information file containing that changelog will be automatically downloaded and the changelog will be displayed for you .
You can even easily change the configuration so the extended information is never downloaded , if you are on a very slow connection or a cellular connection where transferring moderate sized files is very expensive .
Both the graphical and console software installers now inform you how much data must be retrieved from the repositories for the operation you are about to perform , as well as how much hard disk space will be used ( or freed up ) after it is complete .
Drakconnect , the Mandriva network configuration wizard , comes with one major bug fix and several improvements in this release .
Due to changes in the Linux kernel &apos;s driver loading mechanisms , drakconnect &apos;s ability to configure wireless cards to use the ndiswrapper driver ( which provides support for wireless devices by taking advantage of their Windows drivers ) instead of their native Linux drivers , in cases where the native drivers did not perform acceptably , was broken in the most recent Mandriva Linux release .
This problem is resolved in Mandriva Linux 2008 Spring , and you can now easily configure wireless cards to use ndiswrapper using nothing but the Mandriva graphical configuration tool : no manual editing of configuration files is needed any longer .
A major new feature is also introduced to the network configuration tools : support for WPA ##AT##-##AT## EAP , the advanced authentication protocol often used in larger , sophisticated Wi ##AT##-##AT## Fi installations .
If your company , university or other institution uses EAP on its Wi ##AT##-##AT## Fi network , you can now connect seamlessly and easily using only the Mandriva configuration tools .
Aside from these major changes , many more minor fixes and improvements have been introduced , especially in the area of cellular data connections .
Mandriva has a deserved reputation for following the cutting edge of free / open source software development , introducing exciting and interesting new applications and technologies almost as they are developed .
Here &apos;s a few examples of recently developed applications you can try out easily , thanks to Mandriva &apos;s extensive repositories .
Elisa is a sleek , cutting ##AT##-##AT## edge media center based on the Gstreamer media framework .
Elisa concentrates on presenting an attractive , sleek and simple to use interface that makes it both easy and visually appealing to watch videos , listen to music , and browse pictures from a dedicated interface .
Elisa has a heavy emphasis on internet integration , with support for media sharing services like last.fm , Flickr , Youtube and more all built in .
Its architecture makes it easily extensible through the use of plugins .
Mandriva Linux 2008 Spring &apos;s / contrib repository includes the latest version of Elisa , 0.3.5 , and its associated plugins , making it easy to try out , and new versions of Elisa will be made available following 2008 Spring &apos;s release through Mandriva &apos;s extensive / backports repository system .
Avant Window Navigator is an OS X Dock ##AT##-##AT## inspired task manager and window list applet whose modular architecture and extensive configurability make it more flexible and powerful than its inspiration .
Like the Dock , AWN displays an icon for each open application and also lets you add launchers in the same format , letting you use the same simple , intuitive , compact interface for launching applications and switching between them once launched .
AWN &apos;s appearance is also extensively customizable , letting you choose from flat or pseudo ##AT##-##AT## 3D appearances , change colours and effects and even set a background .
AWN takes advantage of the compositing features of Compiz ( or GNOME &apos;s Metacity window manager , with its compositing support enabled ) and modern graphics card drivers to produce a range of visually pleasing effects that also make the interface simple and easy to use .
AWN &apos;s architecture makes it easy to create applets for a wide range of functions , such as an applet that lets you control several different media players , an applet that displays battery power , weather and clock applets and many more , all of which can take advantage of the AWN engine to use advanced graphical effects .
Both AWN and its official plugin package , awn ##AT##-##AT## extras ##AT##-##AT## applets , are available from Mandriva Linux 2008 Spring &apos;s / contrib repository , and new versions of both will be made available following 2008 Spring &apos;s release through the / backports system .
Conduit is a general ##AT##-##AT## purpose synchronization application for GNOME .
It aims to provide a single interface for synchronizing all sorts of data between applications , internet sites and services , and devices .
Its interface makes it extremely simple to set up arbitrary synchronization groups , letting you - for instance - synchronize photos from a photo management application on your computer to Flickr , Facebook , Picasa , and a backup folder ( on a local or remote computer ) all in a single operation . New services for Conduit are being added all the time , but it can already make a wide range of synchronization operations as simple as a single click .
Mandriva Linux 2008 Spring &apos;s / contrib repository includes the latest version of Conduit , 0.3.9 , and new versions will be made available following 2008 Spring &apos;s release through the / backports system .
Miro turns your PC into an internet TV .
Choose your favorite podcast or browse the Miro guide containing a wide range of free video broadcasting sites ( ranging from nature movies to music clips and from news to trailers ) in many languages , then play them all in one go !
As soon as it starts ( which can be at the same moment your desktop is started ) , Miro auto ##AT##-##AT## downloads all your favorite channels and continues downloading them while you &apos;re watching one so you can sit and relax enjoying a continuous flow of your favorite videos .
Mandriva Linux 2008 Spring &apos;s / contrib repository includes Miro 1.1.2 , and new versions will be made available following 2008 Spring &apos;s release through the / backports system .
For the first time in a Mandriva release , an automated package rebuild was carried out during Mandriva Linux 2008 Spring &apos;s development cycle .
All packages in a state where a rebuild could succeed were rebuilt .
Some more obscure packages were still in a state where the rebuild failed for various reasons , so these packages will still be old builds in the 2008 Spring repositories , but the overall consistency of the repositories will be at its highest for many releases .
For future releases , we will continue to work on the packages that are not in a buildable state , so that within a few releases we have to have close to all the packages in the repositories rebuilt for each release .

Mandriva Linux 2009 is one of the most ground ##AT##-##AT## breaking releases of Mandriva Linux , the leader in innovative and easy ##AT##-##AT## to ##AT##-##AT## use desktop Linux , ever .
It introduces KDE 4 - specifically , 4.1.2 - as the default desktop .
This major new release of KDE promises to revolutionize the desktop experience .
Other major new software versions include GNOME 2.24 , OpenOffice.org 3.0 , and Mozilla Firefox 3 .
The Linux kernel version is 2.6.27 .
No less important are the major re ##AT##-##AT## designs of the Mandriva installer and Control Center tools .
As always , Mandriva Linux 2009 &apos;s hardware compatibility is second to none .
As well as conventional systems , it boasts excellent support for a wide range of netbooks , including all currently available Asus Eee PC models , the Acer Aspire One , the MSI Wind , and others .
You can download Mandriva Linux 2009 One or download Mandriva Linux 2009 Free , or buy the boxed , download or subscription Powerpack commercial edition from the Mandriva Store .
Mandriva Linux 2009 includes KDE 4.1.2 as its default desktop .
Several years in the making , KDE 4 is the most radical release yet of the leading Linux desktop environment .
You can find full information about KDE 4 on the KDE web site .
Take a look at the release announcements for KDE 4.0 and KDE 4.1 .
We do recognize , though , that some users will prefer to stick with the familiar KDE 3 environment for now .
For these users , Mandriva Linux 2009 provides a full implementation of the latest KDE 3 release , KDE 3.5.10 , in the / contrib repository .
On a fresh Mandriva Linux 2009 system , you can install the complete KDE 3.5.10 environment by simply installing the package task ##AT##-##AT## kde3 .
If you wish to upgrade to Mandriva Linux 2009 from a previous Mandriva Linux release and preserve your KDE 3 environment , you can do so by doing a network installation or a live upgrade via MandrivaOnline applet , one of the new features of Mandriva Linux 2009 .
See the release notes for more details on this .
Mandriva is no less prompt in bringing you the latest and greatest releases from the other major free software desktop environment , GNOME .
Mandriva Linux features the latest and greatest GNOME release , 2.24 .
You can read more about the new features of GNOME 2.24 in the GNOME 2.24 Release Notes .
Please note that , although these list Ekiga 3 as a feature of GNOME 2.24 , Mandriva Linux 2009 still features Ekiga 2.0.12 as its default version , as 3 is a major revision that was released too close to Mandriva Linux 2009 &apos;s finalization date to be safe .
Ekiga 3 will be available from the / main / backports repository immediately after the release of Mandriva Linux 2009 .
Mandriva Linux 2009 adds another to the extensive list of desktop environments integrated into Mandriva Linux - LXDE .
LXDE is a lightweight yet modern environment designed to give a modern desktop experience on less powerful hardware .
It has been integrated into Mandriva Linux 2009 with a particular eye towards its use on netbook systems , for which it is ideal .
LXDE provides a fast and attractive desktop with a traditional launcher menu and panel , a full configuration application , a file manager ( PCMan File Manager ) , task manager , display configuration tool , image viewer , notepad application , and archive management application .
Installing LXDE on Mandriva Linux 2009 is as easy as installing the task ##AT##-##AT## lxde package .
For more information on LXDE , see the official site , and especially the Mandriva page on the LXDE wiki .
The default web browser in Mandriva Linux , Mozilla Firefox , has been updated to the version 3.0 release series ( 3.0.3 at release time , but Firefox updates frequently and those updates will be made available as official updates throughout the life of Mandriva Linux 2009 ) .
Major new features in version 3.0 include the Smart Location Bar , improved performance and reduced memory consumption , one ##AT##-##AT## click bookmarking , a built in password manager , and improved security features .
You can read more about the features of Mozilla Firefox 3.0 at the official site .
Mandriva Linux 2009 also brings a major new release of the premier open source office suite , OpenOffice.org .
You can read more about the new features of OpenOffice.org 3 on the official site .
The version of OpenOffice.org shipped with Mandriva Linux 2009 is in fact a very late release candidate , rather than the final version 3.0 , which was released too late to be used .
The final version will be provided as a post ##AT##-##AT## release update .
The Mandriva pre ##AT##-##AT## release build is based on the Go ##AT##-##AT## OO project , which adds some improvements of its own .
We have worked hard with Mandriva Linux 2009 to improve boot performance .
Boot speed should be improved by 25 % or more on most systems .
You will also find the system shuts down , hibernates , suspends , and resumes faster .
You can read more about the details of how these improvements were achieved here .
Back when Mandriva Linux 2008 Spring was released , a certain small computer was causing a bit of a stir in the PC world - the original Asus Eee PC .
We recognized it for the game ##AT##-##AT## changer it was , and built 2008 Spring to be Eee ##AT##-##AT## friendly - the first mainstream distribution to integrate polished support for the little system .
Now that original Eee has given birth to a whole family of Eee models and inspired a host of netbooks from other manufacturers , Mandriva Linux 2009 is keeping pace .
2009 includes full hardware support for every currently available Eee model .
We have worked together with the Mandriva Eee user community throughout the development of 2009 . We have used the original Eee as one of our main test machines in performance and usability testing , to make sure Mandriva Linux 2009 boots quickly , performs speedily and is fully usable on the Eee .
All the Mandriva configuration tools have been tested and tweaked where appropriate to fit into the lower resolution screens common on netbooks , and we have also tweaked some third ##AT##-##AT## party applications for this restraint .
As mentioned earlier , we &apos;ve included the lightweight LXDE desktop in the Mandriva Linux 2009 repositories with an eye to netbook users .
And going beyond the Eee , Mandriva Linux 2009 includes excellent out ##AT##-##AT## of ##AT##-##AT## the ##AT##-##AT## box compatibility with other popular netbooks , such as the Acer Aspire One , MSI Wind and more .
If you &apos;ve got a netbook , Mandriva Linux 2009 may just be its new best friend !
Mandriva Linux 2009 introduces a new look for the traditional installer , DrakX ( that &apos;s the installer used on the Free and Powerpack editions ) , and the Mandriva Control Center .
Along with the new look , usability improvements have also been made to both tools .
Both are now based on the modern Webkit HTML rendering engine .
Looks are always important to a distribution , and we think the sleek new look of the Mandriva tools make it one of the best ##AT##-##AT## looking distributions around .
In the past , sharp ##AT##-##AT## eyed users have noticed that after installing Mandriva Linux One , some unnecessary software is present on their system - external driver packages for hardware they do not own ( like ATI or NVIDIA drivers on a system without those cards ) , and localizations for languages they do not use .
In Mandriva Linux 2009 , a post ##AT##-##AT## installation cleaning system has been added to the One installer which offers automatically to remove these packages .
This will save same disk space , reduce the amount of necessary future updates , and can also slightly improve the boot up time .
Mandriva Linux 2009 makes it easier than ever to access the official Mandriva software repositories .
In fact , if you have a working network connection at first boot , they &apos;ll be set up for you automatically .
Now , no single mirror is specified , but a new system is used by which a geographically local and up ##AT##-##AT## to ##AT##-##AT## date mirror will be selected automatically for each operation , using the aria2 downloader .
Aria2 is configured to be adaptative and try the nearest mirrors to achieve best download speed .
Mandriva &apos;s parental control tool , drakguard , has had a time control feature added .
Restrictions can now be based on time - access to certain sites can be allowed or denied at certain times . This was a much ##AT##-##AT## demanded feature for the tool , and makes it much more capable .
Mandriva &apos;s networking configuration tools have added support for several more cellular data devices and providers ( Mandriva has been able to configure cellular data connections , including 3G , for several years ) , and improved signal level detection for wireless connections .
In addition , many new wireless drivers are now supported , and several bugs relating to configuration of more unusual connection types have been fixed .
Mandriva has a deserved reputation for following the cutting edge of free / open source software development , introducing exciting and interesting new applications and technologies almost as they are developed .
Here &apos;s a few examples of recently developed applications you can try out easily , thanks to Mandriva &apos;s extensive repositories .
It can handle a wide range of e ##AT##-##AT## book formats , including fb2 , OEB , OpenReader , Plucker and more .
Its low resource use , simple interface and fast performance makes it the ideal tool to turn your netbook ( or regular laptop ) into an e ##AT##-##AT## book reader .
If you frequently carry your laptop and you like a good read , try it out !

Localization of the Mandriva Linux tools is essential for wide acceptance of Linux on the desktop .
However it goes beyond translating messages word ##AT##-##AT## for ##AT##-##AT## word .
You will want to stay as consistent as possible with the translations for GNOME , KDE , GNU etc .
Also there may be style guides available for translating computer texts into your language .

Reason : Its hard to work and organize w / o organisation or feedback , it would be preferable to have one list for each language . People could exchange each other in their native language .
Reason : The above way could open a door for not so experienced translators too , or some workflow , for testing translations , re ##AT##-##AT## read translations by other persons and so on and so forth . I just can speak for the german translation team , that was nearby non existant some months ago .

Franklin is credited as being foundational to the roots of American values and character , a marriage of the practical and democratic Puritan values of thrift , hard work , education , community spirit , self ##AT##-##AT## governing institutions , and opposition to authoritarianism both political and religious , with the scientific and tolerant values of the Enlightenment .
In the words of Henry Steele Commager , &quot; In Franklin could be merged the virtues of Puritanism without its defects , the illumination of the Enlightenment without its heat .
Franklin &apos;s father , Josiah Franklin , was born at Ecton , Northamptonshire , England on December 23 , 1657 , the son of Thomas Franklin , a blacksmith and farmer , and Jane White .
His mother , Abiah Folger , was born in Nantucket , Massachusetts , on August 15 , 1667 , to Peter Folger , a miller and schoolteacher and his wife Mary Morrill , a former indentured servant .
Folger , founded Folgers Coffee in the 19th century .
Josiah Franklin had seventeen children with his two wives . He married his first wife , Anne Child , in about 1677 in Ecton and emigrated with her to Boston in 1683 ; they had three children before emigrating , and four after .
After her death , Josiah was married to Abiah Folger on July 9 , 1689 in the Old South Meeting House by Samuel Willard . Benjamin , their eighth child , was Josiah Franklin &apos;s fifteenth child and tenth and last son .
Josiah Franklin converted to Puritanism in the 1670s . Puritanism was a Protestant movement in England to &quot; purify &quot; Anglicanism from elements of the Roman Catholic religion , which they considered superstitious .
The roots of American democracy can be seen in these Puritan values of self ##AT##-##AT## government , the importance of the individual and active indignation against unjust authority , which were passed on to Benjamin Franklin and other founding fathers , such as John Adams .
Ben Franklin &apos;s mother , Abiah Folger , was born into a Puritan family that was among the first Pilgrims to flee to Massachusetts for religious freedom , when King Charles I of England began persecuting Protestants . They sailed for Boston in 1635 .
&quot; &#91; 7 &#93; As clerk of the court , he was jailed for disobeying the local magistrate in defense of middle ##AT##-##AT## class shopkeepers and artisans in conflict with wealthy landowners . Ben Franklin followed in his grandfather &apos;s footsteps in his battles against the wealthy Penn family that owned the Pennsylvania Colony .
Benjamin Franklin was born on Milk Street , in Boston , Massachusetts , on January 17 , 1706 &#91; 8 &#93; and baptized at Old South Meeting House . His father , Josiah Franklin , was a tallow chandler , a maker of candles and soap , whose second wife , Abiah Folger , was Benjamin &apos;s mother .
Josiah wanted Ben to attend school with the clergy but only had enough money to send him to school for two years . He attended Boston Latin School but did not graduate ; he continued his education through voracious reading .
He then worked for his father for a time and at 12 he became an apprentice to his brother James , a printer , who taught Ben the printing trade . When Ben was 15 , James created The New ##AT##-##AT## England Courant , the first truly independent newspaper in the colonies .
Her letters were published , and became a subject of conversation around town . Neither James nor the Courant &apos;s readers were aware of the ruse , and James was unhappy with Ben when he discovered the popular correspondent was his younger brother .
After a few months , while working in a printing house , Franklin was convinced by Pennsylvania Governor Sir William Keith to go to London , ostensibly to acquire the equipment necessary for establishing another newspaper in Philadelphia . Finding Keith &apos;s promises of backing a newspaper to be empty , Franklin worked as a typesetter in a printer &apos;s shop in what is now the Church of St Bartholomew ##AT##-##AT## the ##AT##-##AT## Great in the Smithfield area of London .
In 1727 , Benjamin Franklin , 21 , created the Junto , a group of &quot; like minded aspiring artisans and tradesmen who hoped to improve themselves while they improved their community .
&quot; The Junto was a discussion group for issues of the day ; it subsequently gave rise to many organizations in Philadelphia .
Reading was a great pastime of the Junto , but books were rare and expensive .
The members created a library , and initially pooled their own books together .
This did not work , however , and Franklin initiated the idea of a subscription library , where the members pooled their monetary resources to buy books .
This idea was the birth of the Library Company , with the charter of the Library Company of Philadelphia created in 1731 by Franklin .
Franklin hired the first American librarian in 1732 , Louis Timothee .
Originally , the books were kept in the homes of the first librarians , but in 1739 the collection was moved to the second floor of the State House of Pennsylvania , now known as Independence Hall . In 1791 , a new building was built specifically for the library .
The Library Company flourished with no competition and gained many priceless collections from bibliophiles such as James Logan and his physician brother William .
The Library Company is now a great scholarly and research library with 500,000 rare books , pamphlets , and broadsides , more than 160,000 manuscripts , and 75,000 graphic items .
Upon Denham &apos;s death , Franklin returned to his former trade . By 1730 , Franklin had set up a printing house of his own and had contrived to become the publisher of a newspaper called The Pennsylvania Gazette .
The Gazette gave Franklin a forum for agitation about a variety of local reforms and initiatives through printed essays and observations .
Over time , his commentary , together with a great deal of savvy about cultivating a positive image of an industrious and intellectual young man , earned him a great deal of social respect ; though even after Franklin had achieved fame as a scientist and statesman , he habitually signed his letters with the unpretentious &apos; B. Franklin , Printer .
In 1731 , Franklin was initiated into the local Freemason lodge , becoming a grand master in 1734 , indicating his rapid rise to prominence in Pennsylvania .
&#91; 10 &#93; &#91; 11 &#93; That same year , he edited and published the first Masonic book in the Americas , a reprint of James Anderson &apos;s Constitutions of the Free ##AT##-##AT## Masons .
While Franklin was in London , his trip was extended , and there were problems to do with Sir William &apos;s promises of support . Perhaps because of the circumstances of this delay , Deborah married a man named John Rodgers .
Franklin established a common ##AT##-##AT## law marriage with Deborah Read on September 1 , 1730 , &#91; 14 &#93; and besides taking in young William , together they had two children .
The first , Francis Folger Franklin , born October 1732 , died of smallpox in 1736 .
Sarah Franklin , nicknamed Sally , was born in 1743 .
She eventually married Richard Bache , had seven children , and cared for her father in his old age .
Deborah &apos;s fear of the sea meant that she never accompanied Franklin on any of his extended trips to Europe , despite his repeated requests .
However , Franklin did not leave London to visit Deborah even after she wrote to him in November 1769 saying her illness was due to “ dissatisfied distress ” because of his prolonged absence .
&#91; 15 &#93; Deborah Read Franklin died of a stroke in 1774 , while Benjamin was on an extended trip to England .
Any hope of reconcillation was shattered when William Franklin became leader of the The Board of Associated Loyalists — a quasi ##AT##-##AT## military organization , headquartered in British occupied New York City , which , among other things , launched guerilla forages into New Jersey , southern Connecticut , and New York counties north of the city .
&#91; 16 &#93; In the preliminary peace talks in 1782 with Britain &quot; ... Franklin insisted that loyalists who had borne arms against the United States would be excluded from this plea ( that they be given a general pardon ) . He was undoubtedly thinking of William Franklin .
William left New York along with the British troops . He settled in England , never to return .
In 1733 , Franklin began to publish the famous Poor Richard &apos;s Almanack ( with content both original and borrowed ) under the pseudonym Richard Saunders , on which much of his popular reputation is based . Franklin frequently wrote under pseudonyms .
Although it was no secret that Franklin was the author , his Richard Saunders character repeatedly denied it . &quot; Poor Richard &apos;s Proverbs , &quot; adages from this almanac , such as &quot; A penny saved is twopence dear &quot; ( often misquoted as &quot; A penny saved is a penny earned &quot; ) , &quot; Fish and visitors stink in three days &quot; remain common quotations in the modern world .
Wisdom in folk society meant the ability to provide an apt adage for any occasion , and Franklin &apos;s readers became well prepared . He sold about ten thousand copies per year ( a circulation equivalent to nearly three million today ) .
In 1758 , the year in which he ceased writing for the Almanack , he printed Father Abraham &apos;s Sermon , also known as The Way to Wealth .
Franklin &apos;s autobiography , published after his death , has become one of the classics of the genre .
Benjamin Franklin Village , a military housing area in Mannheim , Germany is named after him .
The Franklin Templeton Investments firm ( originally Franklin Distributors , Inc . ) was named in honor of Franklin and uses his portrait in their logo .
The Ben Franklin Bridge , a heavily used , multi ##AT##-##AT## lane bridge spanning the Delaware River , linking Philadelphia , Pennsylvania with Camden , New Jersey was named in honor of Franklin .
When Franklin was minister to France in the 1770s , Paris was awash in miniatures , paintings , statues , and representations of him , usually dressed as a frontiersman .
Short scholarly biography written in 1931 , with links to sources .
The area is named after the Saxons .
The Saxons lived in today &apos;s state of Schleswig ##AT##-##AT## Holstein and merged with the Chauci on the left bank of the river Elbe until the middle of the 1st millennium AD .
They then expanded over the whole of today &apos;s Lower Saxony and further .
Originally the region was simply called Saxony , but as the center of gravity of the Duchy of Saxony gradually moved up the Elbe , towards the present ##AT##-##AT## day states of Saxony ##AT##-##AT## Anhalt and Saxony , the region was given the name of Lower Saxony , which it bore as an Imperial Circle Estate from the late 15th century on .
Historically , Low Saxony esp. the southern regions or the Gottingen region sought a high degree of autonomy .
Today , they have a NFB football ( soccer ) team in a football federation of non ##AT##-##AT## recognized nation states who are not members of the FIFA .
The state was founded in 1946 by the British military administration , who merged the former states of Brunswick , Oldenburg , and Schaumburg ##AT##-##AT## Lippe with the former Prussian province of Hanover .
After the Second World War , the military authorities appointed the first Legislative Assembly ( Landtag ) in 1946 , followed by a direct election of Lower Saxony &apos;s legislature a year later .
It resulted in the election of Social Democrat leader Hinrich Wilhelm Kopf , who became the first prime minister .
Kopf led a five ##AT##-##AT## party coalition , whose basic task was to rebuild a state affected by the war &apos;s rigours .
Kopf &apos;s cabinet had to organise an improvement of food supplies and the reconstruction of the cities and towns destroyed by the Allied air raids of the war years .
In addition , the first state government also faced the challenge of integrating hundreds of thousands of refugees from Germany &apos;s former territories in the east ( such as Silesia and East Prussia ) , which had been annexed by Poland and the Soviet Union .
The north and northwest of Lower Saxony are mainly made up of coarse sandy soil that makes crop farming difficult and therefore grassland and cattle farming are more prevalent in those areas . Towards the south and southeast , extensive loess layers in the soil left behind by the last ice age allow high ##AT##-##AT## yield crop farming .
Mining has been an important source of income in Lower Saxony for centuries . Silver ore became a foundation of notable economic prosperity in the Harz Mountains as early as the 1100s , while iron mining in the Salzgitter area and salt mining in various areas of the state became another important economic backbone .
Although overall yields are comparatively low , Lower Saxony is also an important supplier of crude oil in the European Union .
Mineral products still mined today include iron and lignite .
Radioactive waste is frequently transported in the area to the city of Salzgitter , for the deep geological repository Schacht Konrad and between Schacht Asse II in the Wolfenbüttel district and Lindwedel and Höfer .
Manufacturing is another large part of the regional economy . Despite decades of gradual downsizing and restructuring , the car maker Volkswagen with its five production plants within the state &apos;s borders still remains the single biggest private ##AT##-##AT## sector employer , its world headquarters based in Wolfsburg .
Due to a legal act commonly known as the Volkswagen Law that has just recently been ruled illegal by the European Union &apos; s high court , the state of Lower Saxony is still the second largest shareholder , owning 20.3 % of the company .
&#91; 2 &#93; Due to the importance of car manufacturing in Lower Saxony , a thriving supply industry is centered around its regional focal points . Other mainstays of the Lower Saxon industrial sector include aviation , shipbuilding , biotechnology , and steel .
The service sector has gained importance following the demise of manufacturing in the 1970s and 1980s . Important branches today are the tourism industry with TUI AG in Hanover , one of Europe &apos;s largest travel companies , as well as trade and telecommunication .
The coat of arms shows a white horse ( Saxon Steed ) on red ground , which is an old symbol of the Saxon people .
Since 1948 , politics in the state has been dominated by the rightist Christian Democratic Union ( CDU ) and the leftist Social Democratic Party .
Lower Saxony was one of the origins of the German environmentalist movement in reaction to the state government &apos;s support for underground nuclear waste disposal . This led to the formation of the German Green Party in 1980 .
The current Minister ##AT##-##AT## President , Christian Wulff , has led a coalition of his CDU with the Free Democratic Party since 2003 .
In the most recent state election in 2008 , the ruling CDU held on to its position as the leading party in the state , despite losing votes and seats .
The CDU &apos;s coalition with the Free Democratic Party retained its majority although it was cut from 29 to 10 .
Andorra &#91; 1 &#93; is a small ( pop . 73,100 , size 464 km squared ) , mountainous country in the Pyrenees mountains in Europe , and is on the Iberian Peninsula , on the border between France and Spain , in Southern Europe .
For 715 years , from 1278 to 1994 , Andorrans lived under a unique co ##AT##-##AT## principality ruled by the French chief of state and the Spanish bishop of Urgel .
In 1993 , this feudal system was modified with the titular heads of state retained , but the government transformed into a parliamentary democracy .
Long isolated and impoverished , mountainous Andorra achieved considerable prosperity since World War II through its tourist industry .
Many immigrants ( legal and illegal ) are attracted to the thriving economy with its lack of income taxes .
Visitors from outside the EU should note that Andorra is not a Schengen member , and exiting France or Spain into Andorra will ( theoretically ) terminate a single ##AT##-##AT## entry visa . In practice , though , immigration does not enforce this .
There are no airports in Andorra - however there are daily coach services from the airports in Barcelona in Spain and Toulouse in France to Andorra .
There are no train lines or stations in Andorra , and none close to the Spanish border . However , the French train station of l &apos;Hospitalet is located a few miles from the Andorran border .
It is possible to catch an overnight sleeper train from Paris to l &apos;Hospitalet , as well as many other services . There is a connecting coach service from l &apos;Hospitalet into Andorra , calling at Pas de la Casa , Soldeu and Andorra La Vella .
Roads in Andorra are generally of a good quality .
Entering from the Spanish side is a relatively straightforward drive ; however entering from France is a more stressful affair involving many hairpin bends .
Border control officers at both sides are generally fine , but be prepared for delays during busy times . However , be sure your car is in good condition , since Andorra is very high .
From France there is a coach service , Novatel ( www.andorrabybus.com ) from Toulouse , and one that operates via L &apos;Hospitalet and La Tour de Carol . From Spain , coaches to Andorra can be caught from a variety of locations , such as Barcelona , Madrid , Malaga , Lleida and Valencia .
If you have a few days in Andorra , then you can easily visit most of the main villages by the local bus service .
Andorra &apos;s official language is Catalan , but almost everyone speaks Spanish and / or French .
English and Portuguese are widely spoken too , especially by those involved in the tourism industry .
Most of these resorts were once small mountain villages which have grown in recent years due to skiing .
In recent years the resorts have all joined together so that your ski pass covers neighbouring areas .
As a result there are now just two areas known as Vallnord and Grandvalira .
Grandvalira covers Soldeu and Pas de la Casa .
The Soldeu ski area is also accessible from Encamp and Canillo .
This quite cleverly has opened up these areas to cope with the influence of visitors without putting all the strain on Soldeu .
A good way for hiking and trekking in Andorra is staying at the Himàlaia Hotel in Soldeu &#91; 3 &#93; , that has its own Hiking team of guides who go every day with their guests to walk and discover a lot of interesting hiking routes around the country .
In Andorra La Vella there is the famous Caldea to visit which is a spa / swimming pool complex .
It is located up the top end of La Vella and you cannot miss it because it is the large glass spire structure which is quite an attraction on the skyline itself .

Belize , &#91; 1 &#93; formerly the colony of British Honduras , is the only country in Central America without a coastline on the Pacific Ocean ( only the Caribbean Sea to its east ) , and the only one in the region with English as its official language .
The country is located between Guatemala to the west and south and Mexico to the north .
Along the Caribbean it is culturally similar to many of Britain &apos;s former island colonies .
Inland are native Maya people , and especially in the north and northwest of the country Spanish is often spoken .
Many refugees from the Caste War of Yucatan settled here .
In the south east along the Caribbean coast live the Garifuna ( Black Caribs ) an Afro ##AT##-##AT## Amerindian culture .
World class attractions include exploring the lush jungles with exotic plants and animals , deep sea fishing , swimming , snorkeling and diving in the Caribbean sea with its attractive reefs , and visiting the Mayan ruins .
Tropical ; very hot and humid ; rainy season ( May to November ) ; dry season ( February to May ) .
Hurricanes season ( June to November ) brings coastal flooding ( especially in south ) .
Flat , swampy coastal plain ; low mountains in south .
Highest point : Victoria Peak 1,160 m . Lowest Point : Caribbean Sea , at 0 m .
US , Canadian , Australian , and EU passport holders do not need a visa , but need a valid passport .
Cruise ship visitors do not even need a passport .
The Philip S. W. Goldson International Airport ( IATA : BZE ) ( ICAO : MZBZ ) is in Ladyville , to the northwest of Belize City where it receives international direct flights from Atlanta , Charlotte , Newark , Miami , Dallas , Houston , Flores , San Salvador , Roatan and San Pedro Sula .
From Mexico via Chetumal , or on a much rougher road from Guatemala via Melchor de Mencos .
Buses from Guatemala City and Belmopan operate to Flores in Guatemala , and to Chetumal in Mexico .
Several cruise lines call on Belize City . Unfortunately they usually stay only one day , which doesn &apos;t allow the opportunity to really see Belize .
You can visit one of the Maya ruins , ride an airboat in the salt marshes just outside the city , shop , go to the museum , go to the zoo or take either a short cave rafting trip or go snorkeling , but that &apos;s about it .
That means about 70 % of the things most tourists would like aren &apos;t available , not mention the eco ##AT##-##AT## tourism points of interest .
To Puerto Cortés , Honduras , the Gulf Cruza , a small rickety speed boat ( 20 people ) leaves Placencia each Friday at around 9 : 30AM ( 4h US $ 50 ) , going first to Big Creek . It returns to Placencia on Monday .
Belize is a fairly small country , and transportation between most destinations is rarely long and tedious .
Several competing buslines operate on the main road in the north ##AT##-##AT## south direction from Punta Gorda to Belmopan and Belize City . There are bus stations in the main towns , or simply stand on the side of the highway and wave at an approaching bus .
Most buses have a conductor in addition to the driver , who stands by the door and will come to your seat to collect the fare at some point during the trip . Fares run anywhere from BZ $ 2 ##AT##-##AT## 25 depending on distance traveled .
Most buses in Belize are retired US school buses ( Bluebirds ) , that have been given a slight makeover , a luggage rack installed , and sometimes a new paint job .
They generally aren &apos;t too crowded , but you may have to stand occasionally .
Children selling snacks and soft drinks often board the buses at stops , and this is an inexpensive way to have a snack if you &apos;ve exhausted what you &apos;ve brought along or just want to try some home ##AT##-##AT## made travel foods .
As a former British colony the official language of Belize is English , which makes it stand out from its Spanish speaking neighbors .
The Belize dollar ( BZD , usually symbolized with a &quot; $ &quot; ) is officially worth exactly 1 / 2 of a U.S. dollar .
Most chicken in the country is prepared and served on the bone .
Rice and Beans is a mixed dish with some spices and usually coconut milk added to make a sweet and hot staple of the Belizean diet .
Beans and Rice is white cooked rice with a side of stewed pinto beans .
Citrus plantations are numerous , so fresh oranges and grapefruits are abundant .
Pineapples , papayas , bananas and plantains are also grown and sold in roadside markets .
A famous hot sauce in Belize is Marie Sharp &apos;s made from the very potent local habanero pepper .
It comes in a variety of flavors ( mild , hot , extremely hot ) .
Guinness Stout is also available in Belize but it is brewed by the Belikin Brewing Co . All are sold in returnable bottles , so make sure you are aware of the deposit if you are taking your beverages to go .
Both are widely available around the country .
But if you also like wine there is cashew wine ( which is very popular in Belize ) , ginger wine , sorrel wine and blackberry wine .
There are great opportunities for scuba diving off of Belize atolls .
Check out reefci.com for some very interesting 1 week adventures that are both informative conservation education as well as great scuba diving .
If you want to learn about Belize &apos;s history the Museum of Belize , House of Culture , and of course , traveling and discovering are recommended .
Other areas of Belize are generally safe as well , but like any other place in the world , one should always have some skepticism when dealing with strangers . Most are genuinely helpful , but it never hurts to be cautious .
Belize is a relatively healthy country .
Bottled water is a must in most areas .
And , unless you eat only at ultra ##AT##-##AT## touristic restaurants , dysentery will probably strike at some point ; be prepared with over ##AT##-##AT## the ##AT##-##AT## counter medication and prescription antibiotics .
The CDC lists all of Belize except Belize City as a malaria risk area , and recommends the antimalarial drug chloroquine .
The sun , as anywhere else in the tropics , is very intense .
A hat , high ##AT##-##AT## SPF sunscreen , and sunglasses should do you fine .
Many places in Belize are very hot and humid , and dehydration is a risk .
An expat suggests to drink as much water as you want , and then drink that much again .
The adult HIV / AIDS prevalence rate is currently at 2.5 % or 1 per 40 adults , which is 4 times higher than the USA and 25 times higher than the UK .
Belizeans are some of the most socially relaxed people in the world , especially if you venture inland away from the tourist islands of Ambergris Caye and Caye Caulker .
The pace of life is generally slower in Belize , so it &apos;s good practice to begin any social interaction , even to ask a quick question , with eye contact and a genuinely pleasant greeting . Most rural Belizeans enjoy casual conversation and you could easily find yourself chatting it up for a few hours .
The Maya communities can be a little more reserved at times .
As always , a little respect and politeness will carry you through .
Payphones are the most common public phones in country , and accept pre ##AT##-##AT## purchased phone cards .

It may be best to avoid independent travel outside Bujumbura at this time . Tours and / or guides can help make travel outside the capital relatively safe , but your route may be subject to change if conflict arises near planned desrtinations .
The people currently known as Hutu and Tutsi moved into the region several hundred years ago , and dominated it . Like much of Africa , Burundi then went through a period of European colonial rule , ending with its independence from Belgium in 1962 .
In the decades since then , it has been the scene of recurring brutal mutual bloodlettings between the Hutu and Tutsi populations ( much like the better ##AT##-##AT## known genocide in neighboring Rwanda ) , and a series of political assassinations . Peace and the ( re ) establishment of civil democracy took place in 2005 with a cease ##AT##-##AT## fire and the election of former Hutu rebel Pierre Nkurunziza as president .
Bujumbura International Airport is served by the following passenger airlines : Kenya Airways ( Nairobi ) ; Rwandair Express ( Kigali , Johannesburg ) ; Ethiopian ( Addis Ababa ) ; Brussels Airlines ( Brussels ) . Air Burundi has recently begun operating passenger services from Bujumbura to Kigali and from Kigali to Bujumbura almost Monday through Sunday .
Burundi is a very nice place to travel and it will leave a mark on you .
Although some semblance of normalcy has returned to much of the country with the conclusion of the nation &apos;s democratic transition and a democratically chosen head of state in August , 2005 , travelers should be warned that there is still significant insecurity throughout the country and exercise extreme caution . Besides the still ##AT##-##AT## active rebel group , the Forces Nationales de la Liberation ( FNL ) , who continue to attack government forces and civilians , threats posed by banditry and armed robbery , as well as petty crimes remain .

Cotopaxi is the world &apos;s highest active volcano .
Colonial City . Quito is one of the first UNESCO World Heritage Cities .
Baños - The adventure capital of Ecuador . In this city you can find an active volcano having small eruptions of ash and lava .
Guayaquil - Largest city in the country and largest port city .
Manta - the most important seaport of the country .
Riobamba -- Starting point of the famous train ride down the Nariz del Diablo and gateway to Mount Chimborazo , Ecuador &apos;s highest peak , whose summit is the furthest point on Earth from its centre .
Esmeraldas - One of the most popular beaches in Ecuador .
Galapagos Islands -One of the most beautiful places in the world , with endemic species just seen here .
Santo Domingo de los Colorados -where the tsáchilas live .
Playas - Second Best climat in the world With amazing long beaches and great places to surf .
The &quot; Republic of the Ecuador &quot; was one of three countries that emerged from the collapse of Gran Colombia in 1830 ( the others being Colombia and Venezuela ) .
Between 1904 and 1942 , Ecuador lost territories in a series of conflicts with its neighbors . A border war with Peru that flared in 1995 was resolved in 1999 .
Radio and / or television is available in Spanish except in some of the particularly remote areas . English ##AT##-##AT## language movies usually are shown in the original language with Spanish subtitles .
Many hotels have cable television that may include English ##AT##-##AT## language stations and / or premium movie channels that feature subtitled movies in their original languages .
Ecuador adopted the United States dollar ( USD ) as its currency in 2000 .
Quito &apos; s airport has an executive lounge shared by all the airlines with drinks , snacks , and seating areas .
The view is not of the airplanes and runway , but there is a view of the airport entrance and the surrounding mountains .
Business class travelers get a free invitation .
Another port of entry is Guayaquil , which has a modern airport that includes the typical amenities such as restaurants and duty ##AT##-##AT## free shopping .
The airport is located north from downtown .
The Galapagos Islands are one of the Ecuadorian provinces and have two airports , one of which is on Baltra and the other is on San Cristobal .
The Quito airport charges an international departure tax of $ 40.80 .
This tax usually is not included in the cost of the flight .
There are no international train services into Ecuador .
Driving into Ecuador is discouraged . It is preferable to enter the country by airplane or boat because of the frontier issues with neighboring countries .
If you enter Ecuador by bus you usually have to switch buses at the border . If come from Colombia you have to cross the border at Rumichaca near Tulcan and Ipiales ( Colombia ) .
There are several places to cross the border with Peru . As of December 2007 , the Ecuador / Colombia border crossing is reguarded as a safe and hassle free while the Ecuador / Peru border crossing is much more dangerous with the likelihood of being scammed out of hundreds of dollars .
In February 2009 , a tourist asked the bus company that he took from Lima to Tumbes , Peru about getting to Quito , Ecuador by bus .
They directed him to a man that went with him in a taxi .
They claimed that there were problems at the border and that might make it so he would need to pay off police to get across .
In the end , they took him to a secluded place by the border and demanded $ 70 USD .
Advice : Make sure you know the border situation before arriving in Tumbes .
The best way to discover the wonders of the four regions of Ecuador is thru a Tour Operator .
Many cities have a central bus terminal , known as the terminal terrestre , where it is possible to buy tickets from the various bus lines that serve the city . Long ##AT##-##AT## distance buses typically cost from $ 1 to $ 2 per hour , depending on the distance and the type of service ; groups may be able to negotiate discounts .
The bathroom on the bus , if any , is usually reserved for women . However , it is permissible for men to request that the bus make a stop so that they might relieve themselves .
The bus rides themselves are often quite beautiful , through mountain views in the clouds . These altitude changes cause many of the same ear pressure problems which are associated with an airplane ride .
Amerindian languages ( especially Quichua ) are generally spoken in the more rural , mountainous villages .
English is widely spoken in hotels , restaurants and other businesses that cater to high ##AT##-##AT## end travelers .
Ecuadorians are friendly and generally tolerant of foreigners who attempt to speak Spanish but make mistakes .
Ecuador uses the U.S. dollar as its currency .
Other types of currency are not readily accepted .
U.S. paper money is used for most transactions . Ecuador has its own coins , which are exactly the same size and weight as U.S. coins up through 50 ##AT##-##AT## cent pieces ; both they and U.S. coins are used .
U.S. Sacagawea dollar coins are also widely used , more so than in the U.S. Susan B. Anthony dollars , however , are not generally accepted . Many merchants examine large bills ( $ 10 and above ) carefully to make sure they aren &apos;t counterfeit .
Take lots of one and five dollar bills with you ; you will also want to bring the newest possible bills . Worn bills are often reguarded with suspicion , and it is not uncommon for a merchant to ask you to pay with another bill if the one you handed them appears old or worn .
Travelers &apos; checks can be exchanged at some ( but not all ) banks for a reasonable fee ( usually not more than 3 percent ) .
They are also accepted at some hotels that cater to tourists , although it is difficult to use them elsewhere .
There is often a surcharge added to use traveler &apos;s checks .
Credit and debit cards are accepted at many places that cater to tourists as well as at some upscale shops .
However , many places charge a commission for their use as reimbursement for what the banks charge them . You may be asked to show your passport when using a credit or debit card .
Most claim to be tied in with major international networks , in theory making it possible to withdraw money from foreign accounts .
Depending on the transaction fees charged by your bank at home , ATMs offer very good exchange rates . Be aware that you may have to try quite a few different machines before receiving money .
Avoid using ATMs on the street as their users are frequently targeted by street thieves . Hotels or other places with a guard nearby are your best choices .
Even though Ecuador is a very beautiful country it does not know how to sell itself very well .
In Quito a very famous touristic site is El Mercado Artesenal where many souvenirs can be found but after a thorough look around you will realize that there is a bit of redundancy in the items in the sense that everyone is basically selling the same thing so after buying a few main items it becomes difficult to find much more variety .
Almost everything that can be bought has a price that can be bargained and if you are not a native , they will try and get higher prices out of you which is why it is recommended to go with someone who is either fluent in Spanish or native , to bargain more effectively .
Aguardiente , often made from fermented sugar cane , is the local firewater .
Oftentimes the hostels in smaller towns are actually privately owned homes that welcome travellers . As with most things , natives can help you find an excellent hotel at a very low price ( $ 6 ##AT##-##AT## 14 ) .
Again , large groups will be able to bargain for lower prices . Air conditioning is an amenity which often comes at an extra cost of a dollar or two a night .
An excellent way to get to know and understand more of the country is to do some voluntary work .
There are several organizations that arrange work for international volunteers in Ecuador and other countries in the region .
Most tourists who avoid flashing large amounts of money , visiting areas near the Colombian border , civil disturbances , side streets in big cities at night and that sort of thing report few problems . Probably the biggest threat in most places is simple thievery : Belongings should not be left unguarded on the beach , for example , and pickpockets can be found in some of the more crowded areas , especially the Trolébus ( Metro ) in Quito , in bus terminals and on the busses themselves .
You can always ask tourist police officers , police officers or in Tourist information center for the dangerous regions .
Ecuador offers great opportunities for hiking and climbing , unfortunately , some travelers have been attacked and robbed in remote sections of well known climbs - several rapes have also been reported so female hikers / climbers need to be extremely careful .
Travelers are urged to avoid solo hikes and to go in a large group for safety reasons .
Ecuador is widely considered to be a developing country and health hazards are a significant issue .
Of the most significant are foodborne illnesses , though they can easily be treated with digestive drugs such as antacids or antidiarrheals .
Bottled water is the key in Ecuador if you don &apos;t want to get sick .
This doesn &apos;t only apply to foreigners who don &apos;t have the stomach for Ecuadorian food but also Ecuadorians who know that if they don &apos;t boil their water or drink it from the bottle that they can get very sick .
As a result , it can be purchased almost everywhere ( even in the most remote places ) for well under $ .025-.50 .
Water bottles are sometimes provided by hostels and hotels , which can be used for brushing teeth .
It is advisable to receive a typhoid vaccination , and possibly a yellow fever vaccination , depending on your specific area of travel .
Among many other cultural idiosyncrasies , in the Sierra regions it is considered impolite to use a downward ##AT##-##AT## facing palm as a reference for the height of a person . Instead , the hand is held on its side , and the measurement taken from the lower edge to the floor .
When motioning for someone to &quot; come here , &quot; it is impolite to motion your hand with the palm facing up . Instead , use a downward swipe of the hand with the palm facing down .
Acceptable clothing varies by region of the country .
In the mountainous Sierra region , including Quito , clothes are usually more warm because of the weather .
On the coast , meanwhile , more casual clothes predominate .
Internet cafes can be found nearly everywhere in the major cities and in many of the smaller ones .
Cost is from $ 1 to $ 2 per hour in the large cities , and the better places have high ##AT##-##AT## speed access .
In some coffees , restaurant and hotels are free wifi access most of them protected by passwords ; in the most of the cases you just have to ask for the password .

England &#91; 1 &#93; is the largest of the four &quot; home nations &quot; that make up the United Kingdom . It is also the most populous of the four with almost 52 million inhabitants ( roughly 90 % of the total population of the UK ) .
On the island of Great Britain , Scotland sits to the north of England and Wales is to the west . Northern Ireland ( also part of the UK ) and the Republic of Ireland lie across the Irish Sea to west of England ( and Wales ) .
London - the capital of both England and the United Kingdom , a vast metropolitan area , and a global capital of finance , fashion and culture . This city , which is the biggest in Europe is not to be missed .
A number of roads cross England &apos;s borders with its British neighbours .
These roads range from the simple country lanes to motorways .
There are no border controls with Scotland or Wales ; indeed , on smaller roads the border may not be noticed at all .
Eurostar links mainland Europe to England .
Trains run from Paris , France and Brussels , Belgium ( via Lille and Calais ) crossing into England via the Channel Tunnel ( and often stopping at Ashford ) before continuing to St. Pancras Station in London .
Occasional services run from other destinations in France .
There are still low ##AT##-##AT## quality establishments or mediocre chain restaurants for people who do not care for good food ( or for spending good money on it ) , but the last thirty years have seen huge improvements . England has become a major holiday destination , and restaurants and hotels have learned what demanding travellers want .
The English themselves have learned to appreciate good food by visiting countries all over the world and have come home expecting pubs and restaurants to justify their prices by providing interesting and well ##AT##-##AT## presented meals . &quot; A meal out &quot; is the usual way to celebrate a special family event , and people expect the meal to live up to the occasion .
Fish and chips — deep ##AT##-##AT## fried , battered fish ( usually cod or haddock ) with chips ( french fries in America ) , best from specialist fish and chip shops ( very different article from &quot; fish and chips &quot; on a general restaurant or pub menu ) .
Available throughout the UK ( see that article for more information on finding perfect fish and chips ) .
Roast dinner ( also known as the &quot; Sunday roast &quot; due to the day it is traditionally consumed on ) is available between lunchtime and early evening in virtually any English pub serving food . Quality will vary greatly depending on how freshly cooked the food is ( home cooked is invariably better ) .
Yorkshire Pudding — a batter pudding served with a roast ( usually beef ) ; originally used instead of a plate and eaten with the meal . Giant version often appears on ( not very refined ) pub menus as a main meal item , with a &quot; filling &quot; ( Giant Yorkshire Pudding filled with beef stew ) .
Pubs are a good place to get reasonably priced food , though most stop serving food at around 9 ##AT##-##AT## 9 : 30pm . Others may stop serving food between lunch and dinner .
Pub food has become quite sophisticated in recent years and as well as serving the more traditional hearty English fare , more exotic dishes are now prepared in the majority of the larger pubs and specialist &quot; gastropubs &quot; .
These are normally named after local landmarks or events , and most will have a heraldic ( or pseudo ##AT##-##AT## heraldic ) symbol on the sign outside ; more recent establishments may poke fun of this tradition ( e.g. &quot; The Queen &apos;s Head &quot; featuring a portrait of Freddie Mercury , lead singer for the rock band Queen ) .
Be warned though , some traditional English pubs can get very rough , and if you are uneasy about seeing big , burly , drunk men shouting , swearing and fighting , it &apos;s best just to avoid these places . You &apos;re only likely find pubs like that if you venture into rougher areas of a town .
Over the last twenty years , there has been a slow but persistent trend for local ( non ##AT##-##AT## town ##AT##-##AT## centre ) pubs to close down : in particular , rural pubs outside tourist areas have suffered , perhaps from a reduced tolerance for &quot; drink ##AT##-##AT## driving &quot; .
Some have even become more like restaurants , with a bar area for people waiting to be seated : these types can be less than welcoming to people who just want a drink .
In town centres , the establishments lining the main &quot; drinking streets &quot; are more of the &quot; stylish bar &quot; type than pubs : they are often designed for &quot; vertical drinking &quot; ( standing near very loud loudspeakers , holding fashionable bottles of lager or &quot; alcopops &quot; ) rather than for discussing the finer points of football or beer around a collection of pint glasses on a table .
However , back streets still hide traditional pubs , and most towns have several &quot; real ale pubs &quot; dotted around , sometimes with a cluster concentrated in a small area on the edge of the town centre .

Florida is possibly the largest state for cruise ship embarkation in the United States .
Port Canaveral , Tampa , and Miami are all popular ports for embarkation , with cruises heading throughout the Carribean .
There are also many casino cruises which depart from Pinellas County and South Florida .
Car rental agencies abound in Florida and many are available at every major airport .
Orlando , in particular , known as the &quot; Car Rental Capital of the World &quot; .
The following companies are found at multiple airports throughout the state : Avis , Dollar , Enterprise &#91; 3 &#93; , E ##AT##-##AT## Z Rent ##AT##-##AT## A-Car &#91; 4 &#93; , Hertz &#91; 5 &#93; , Payless Car Rental , Thrifty .
And with Florida being the US most visited state , car rental rates here are among ( if not the ) lowest rates in the country .
U.S. Highway 1 is a historic and scenic highway which originates in Key West and continues up the east coast .
State Road A1A runs parallel to US 1 and Interstate 95 , but lies to the east of the Intercoastal Waterway ( mainly on the barrier islands ) and running mostly along the ocean .
US 98 enters Florida from Alabama at Pensacola and travels a very scenic route along the Gulf Coast of the Panhandle , it continues diagonally across the peninsula to its terminus in West Palm Beach .
US 41 runs from Miami , makes a scenic 2 ##AT##-##AT## lane journey through the Everglades , and travels along the Gulf Coast , the east side of Tampa Bay , and north into Georgia .
Amtrak Silver Star and Silver Meteor ( Trains 91 ##AT##-##AT## 92 and 97 ##AT##-##AT## 98 respectively ) - This is a relatively expensive option but will suffice if other means are not possible . Both routes span from Jacksonville to Miami .
While the two routes are slightly different , within the borders of state of Florida , the routes are exactly the same and stop at the following stations : Jacksonville , Palatka , DeLand , Winter Park , Orlando , Kissimmee , Lakeland ( to / from the north only ) , Tampa , Lakeland ( to / from the south only ) , Winter Haven , Sebring , Okeechobee , West Palm Beach , Delray Beach , Deerfield Beach , Fort Lauderdale , Hollywood , and Miami .
Holocaust museum , &#91; 8 &#93; , located in downtown St. Petersburg . The Holocaust museum is one of the largest in the US and exhibits a Polish box car used to transport prisoners to concentration camps .
Daytona International Speedway , located in downtown St.Petersburg1.5 miles off the Daytona Beach exit ( 261 ) on I ##AT##-##AT## 95 . Home of the number one event in stock car racing - the NASCAR Nextel Cup Series Daytona 500 ( February ) and other events throughout the year .
Go to the beach ! You have numerous options here , Panama City Beach , Daytona Beach , and West Palm Beach are some of the best .
Visit Florida &apos;s world class water parks and theme parks .
Disney World - The biggest and most renowned theme park in the world .
Sea World , Wet and Wild , Universal Studios , Islands of Adventure , and Discovery Cove in Orlando .
Never leave children or pets in a parked car for any length of time !
Due to high temperature for most of the year , the interior of a parked car can easily heat to lethal temperatures in a short amount of time .
During the summer , the interior of a parked car can reach 130 ##AT##-##AT## 170ºF ( 55 ##AT##-##AT## 75ºC ) in just 15 minutes , regardless of the color of the exterior or interior , nor whether the windows are open a small amount . You not only risk death , but it is illegal and the consequences are taken VERY seriously ... including thousands in fines and even imprisonment .
Florida has a high occurrence of hurricanes .
You might want to check the Hurricane safety page if you are visiting Florida during Hurricane Season ( June 1 ##AT##-##AT## November 30 ) .
While the beaches are great they often harbor rip currents , bacteria , and jellyfish . Always check with the lifeguard stand before heading in if no one is in the water or the waves are rough .
Volusia County is known for a high number of shark attacks , so be careful when surfing . Even so , the number of attacks are less than 50 , with a fatal attack every 2 ##AT##-##AT## 3 years , amongst millions of visitors and residents who swim in the ocean .
Never swim in the lakes or rivers unless signs tell you swimming is safe . In Florida , stagnant and slow moving freshwater often has alligators ( as well as poisonous snakes ) .
Florida has varying crime intensity from city to city .
In certain parts of large cities it may not be safe to walk alone or even in small groups at night .
These are the exceptions however and most of Florida is safe enough for visitors .
Touristy areas rarely have violent crimes , but theft is an occasional occurrence .
Only central Africa experiences more lightning than Florida . The afternoon thunderstorms in Florida produce frequent lightning which kills many people each year and injures many more .
Try to remain indoors during a thunderstorm and NEVER seek shelter under a tree . Most casualties occur on golf courses , but lightning strikes everywhere .
If you must go outdoors , try to stay away from tall objects such as trees .
Occasionally , summer thunderstorms will bring hail , high winds , and tornadoes .
While historic numbers of tornadoes in Florida are somewhat high , the overwhelming majority occur during hurricanes ( Jeanne alone spawned over 200 tornadoes in FL ) and the rest during winter cold fronts and summer thunderstorms ; however , 99 % of them are F ##AT##-##AT## 0 or F ##AT##-##AT## 1 .
Thus , while statistics may suggest otherwise , tornadoes are not a big hazard in Florida .

Tsitsikamma National Park : encloses one of the most beautiful coasts in South Africa between Storms River and Nature &apos;s Valley .
South African Airways has regular flights to George and Port Elizabeth , which is reachable with budget airlines Kulula and 1Time .
The N2 is the main highway that passes through the Garden Route , connecting Cape Town with Port Elizabeth .
The main companies offer regular services along the Garden Route from Cape Town and Port Elizabeth .
The region is also on the Baz Bus route .
As local public transport between the towns is rare ( except minibus services ) , the best way to tour the Route is by car .
You can hire a car all along the Garden Route , be aware though that there is a fee if you drop the car off somewhere else from where you have picked it up .
Substantial roadworks are in progress on the N2 with the current single lane sections being upgraded to double lanes in both ways .
Imagine the intro photo on this article with two extra lanes being constructed on the left of the current road .
Some sections are restricted to single direction traffic flow with manned stop / go control points .
Typical delay at these points are 20 minutes each .
Expect delays and plan your travel accordingly .
As a main tourist destination there are many restaurants for every taste .
Enjoy superb fish from the ocean ; Knysna is the place to taste some oysters .
Compared with the larger cities the towns along the Garden Route are quite safe .
As always use your common sense .

Groningen &#91; 1 &#93; is a city in The Netherlands with 185.000 inhabitants and is the capital of Groningen .
Since 1614 the city has its university : the &apos; Rijksuniversiteit Groningen &apos; . The city Groningen was founded around 1100 A.D. and has a rich history , which can clearly be told from the old medieval buildings in the down town area .
Groningen has three train stations , the Central Station , the Southern Station ( Groningen Europapark ) and the Northern Station ( Groningen Noord ) . All trains eventually arrive at the Central Station .
All buses going to the city of Groningen eventually arrive at the Central Station .
Driving in the old city is not the best option ; parking is not always easy to find , none of it free .
It is clearly marked when driving on the ring road . Parking there is free , and for a euro a regular bus service takes you right to ( and from ) the Grote Markt , the heart of the city , within a couple of minutes .
Getting from any place in Groningen to the centre will take at most 20 minutes by bike . This makes the bike a fast , cheap and easy way to travel Groningen .
The centre of Groningen has many nice little cafes or restaurants where you can eat . Groningen is a real university city , so there are plenty of cafe ##AT##-##AT## restaurants where you can eat for about € 10 .
Eeterie De Globe , A ##AT##-##AT## Kerkhof 22 , 3 different main courses each day ( one meat , one fish , one veg .
Groningen &apos;s reputation as university town is borne out in its nightlife , which is comprehensive , with numerous options for drinking and clubbing . There are also several places to play pool / billiards .
Groningen also has a few excellent coffeeshops , where you can buy and smoke cannabis products at a reasonable price .

Unrest in Sierra Leone has spilled across the border , creating humanitarian emergencies and threatening the stability of this country .
Visa inquiries must be made at Guinea embassies , and are not available at the borders or airport .
Though cargo trains still run the old line between Conakry and Kankan , there are no passenger trains still operational in Guinea . The old station in downtown Conakry is worth a visit .
In 2008 travel between Guinea and Liberia was safe , though time consuming .
The prices are affordable , service is excellent , and the staff is generally very friendly . You can stay there for as long as you like ( they won &apos;t kick you out ) .
Water bottled in the town of Coyah is available everywhere for about US $ .50 per 1.5 liter bottle and is very good . Conakry &apos;s tap water is generally not safe unless filtered / boiled .

A civil war in 1998 , followed by the imposition of a military junta in 1999 has been replaced with a multi ##AT##-##AT## party democracy . The economy remains fragile , however hopes are high .
Guinea ##AT##-##AT## Bissau is divided into 8 regions ( regiões ) and 1 autonomous sector ( sector autónomo ) , and are subdivided into 37 sectors .
To complicate matters more , the GB &quot; Diplomatic Representation &quot; in Washington is &quot; temporarily closed &quot; ( since Jan . 2007 &amp; current as of Feb . 2009 ) and the US embassy in Bissau is closed . Visa ##AT##-##AT## seekers are advised to visit the GB Embassies in either Dakar , Senegal or Lisbon , Portugal for visas .
Direct flights from Portugal with TAP &#91; 5 &#93; every friday , returning same day . There is a daily Air Senegal flight &#91; 6 &#93; from Dakar , Senegal to Bissau and back .
Other main borderposts include Pirada ( dirtroad from there to Gabú ) to Senegal , and Buruntuma to Guinea -Conakry ( also via Gabú ) .
In Bissau minibuses called toca ##AT##-##AT## toca work for transports within the city .
For inter ##AT##-##AT## city travel there are sept ##AT##-##AT## places , ( seven ##AT##-##AT## seat Peugeot ) and candongas , big commercial vehicles carrying ten to twenty passengers .
Prefer sept ##AT##-##AT## place or at least try to get the front seats . It is also possible to rent taxis to other towns and cities .
Portuguese is the official language and the language used for writing , however creole is the language spoken among the locals . There are several local languages such as Fula , Balanta , Mandinka , Pepel , Bijago etc .
Before traveling , make sure you have the yellow fever , hepatitis A , tetanus and typhoid vaccinations up to date . Malaria prophylaxis is highly recommended - consult a medical doctor for advice on which type to choose .
Depending on the length and purpose of your stay , also consider vaccinations for typhoid fever , hepatitis B , rabies , meningitis and tuberculosis .

Remember to pack your swiss army knives in hold luggage .
Watches : Interlaken has two main watch and jewellery shops : &quot; Bucherer &quot; and &quot; Kirchhofer &quot; which stock all the big traditional Swiss brands ( Tag Heuer , Omega , IWC , Rolex ) . Alternatively , most souvenir shops sell some inexpensive Swiss made watches like Swiss Military and Swatch .
For a small Swiss town , Interlaken has quite the nightlife options , including Switzerland &apos;s one and only Hooters Bar &amp; Restaurant . Most of these bars serve the seasonal tide of tourists , but off the main road , many more mellow local venues can be found .
The two best nightlife spots in town are Balmer &apos;s hostel and the Funny Farm , which are located fairly close to each other ( both at Hauptstrasse , Matten ) .
Balmers has a decent underground bar and dance club and the Funny Farm has great outdoor chill out areas , including a bonfire . Both hostels have good happy hour specials , and you can kind of bounce back and forth between the two to get your drink for the best price .

Hagar Qim and Mnajdra - Two very beautiful stone age temples set on the cliffside of south west Malta . Their majesty has now been marred by protective tents and a 2 storey new building nearby .
Blue Grotto - A series of seven caves and inlets on the southern side of Malta famous for deep blue waters and spectacular natural rock formations . The Blue Grotto may be accessed by small traditional boats , skippered by cheerful Maltese guides , which leave from a well ##AT##-##AT## signposted pier just off the main road along the south coast .
Although small , Malta has a long and rich history , with evidence for habitation going back to the Neolithic era ( 4th millennium B.C. ) .
The country boasts some of the world &apos;s most ancient standing buildings ( the Neolithic temples ) , and its strategic location and good harbors in the middle of the Mediterannean have attracted Phoenicians , Greeks , Romans , Arabs , Normans , Crusaders , the French and finally the British , with the colonial period lasting until 1964 .
The Knights of the Order of St. John of Jerusalem , also known as the Knights Hospitallers and Knights of Malta , took over sovereign control of Malta in 1530 , and by 1533 the Order had built a hospital at Birgu ( one of the Three Cities ) to care for the sick . In 1565 , Suleiman the Magnificent , Sultan of the Ottoman Empire , mounted a great siege of Malta with a fleet of 180 ships and a landing force of 30,000 men .
In 1798 , the French under Napoleon took the island on 12 June , without resistance , when the Grand Master of the Order capitulated after deciding that the island could not be defended against the opposing French naval force . French rule lasted a little over 2 years , until they surrendered to the British Royal Navy , under Admiral Nelson &apos;s command , in September 1800 .
Great Britain formally acquired possession of Malta in 1814 .
The island staunchly supported the UK through both World Wars .
Malta remained in the Commonwealth of Nations when it became independent from Great Britain in 1964 .
Malta gained European Union membership in May 2004 .
Malta &apos;s Climate is influenced by the Mediterranean Sea and is similar to other Mediterranean climates . Winters are wet and and windy .
Summers are virtually guaranteed to be dry and hot .
Mostly low , rocky , flat to dissected plains , with a coastline &#91; 4 &#93; that has many coastal cliffs and numerous bays that provide good harbors .
Malta has joined the Schengen agreement , which means that you can enter on a European Union Schengen visa and there are no longer any ID / passport controls on the EU borders .
No visa is required for entry by EU , Canadian , and American citizens . Visitors from outside the EU , including Americans , must fill out a landing card , available on board some arriving flights ( sometimes ) or in the entrance hall of the airport from the small box between the customs agents .
Malta possesses its own national carrier , Air Malta &#91; 5 &#93; , with regular connections to many European , North African and Middle Eastern centres .
Ryanair &#91; 6 &#93; flies to / from London Luton , Edinburgh , Dublin , Madrid , Trapani , Bristol , Bremen , Pisa , Stockholm ( Skavsta ) , Valencia , Girona and Bari .
Easyjet flies to / from Manchester newcastle and London Gatwick .
The island &apos;s international Airport &#91; 7 &#93; is located at Luqa .
There are frequent fast ferries to the Sicilian port of Catania 3 hours and Pozzallo 90 min , Italy .
but it can be turbulent with a heavy swell , if it &apos;s windy.usually trip takes around twice the time on large passenger ships but fares are lot cheaper and easier which make it ideal for drivers of car , trucks , campers , etc , other destination includes from , Livorno , Salerno , Rome ( civitavechia ) , Palermo , Genoa and Tunis but usually with airlines like ryanair , windjet and efly are cheaper and easier .
A short question - &quot; To Valletta ? &quot; - to the driver when you get on will help you confirm your ending destination .
The only problem there might be is the smouldering heat during the summer but a typical bus ride is only around 20 minutes so it should be fine .
A typical bus fare is € 0.47 so do not expect to give € 20 to change as you will probably be denied a bus fare ( with good reason ) , so be ready with reasonable change when getting on a bus .
Also , most buses usually stop running around 21.30 - 22.00 . So make sure you have an alternate means of transport for evening journeys .
There is , of course , the exception of a Friday or Saturday night out in Paceville ( ONLY LEAVING PV ) - there are buses leaving at 00.00 , 01.30 and 03.00 . Most of these are &apos; direct &apos; routes so make sure you know the number for your destination .
Malta &apos;s white taxis are a ravenous lot and fares are quite expensive .
These are the ones you can pick you up off the street .
They have meters that are uniformly ignored , figure on € 12 for short hops and not much more than € 30 for a trip across the island .
For airport transfers and local taxis try using one of the local &quot; Black cab &quot; taxi firms such as Swansea Chauffeur Drive &#91; 8 &#93; or Wembleys &#91; 9 &#93; for airport transfers . Their rates are normally lower than white taxis and their drivers are smarter and more educated .
Their services must be prebooked however ( at least fifteen minutes notice ) since SwanSea and Wembley cabs cannot be picked up from the street and have to be prebooked or called ( 356 ) 20107444 or ( 356 ) 21313261 . Wembley is the largest taxi firm but Swansea offers a more reliable , personalised and professional service at roughly the same rates .
A new shared transport service maltatransfer.com started operating from the Malta Internation airport to all hotels in Malta &amp; Gozo .
Prices for the transfers are very cheap and you can prebook on line from &#91; 10 &#93; or you can purchase your ticket from the desk which is situated in the arrivals luggage reclaim section while waiting for your luggage .
They have speciale offers for group bookings as well .
Renting a car in Malta is a fine way to see the country , since it &apos;s cheap ( try Swansea car hire &#91; 11 &#93; or Active car rental &#91; 12 &#93; ) and driving conditions have improved greatly in the last ten years . Having your own car allows you to make a lot more of your trip and discover the many hidden charms these small islands have to offer .
According to the Mediterranean markets , Malta has very low rates for car rental . Any driver and additional drivers must take with them their driving licenses in order to be covered for by the insurances provided by the local car rental supplier .
There is GPS coverage of the Island by popular brands such as and I GO Garmin , however , do check with your rental company as to whether they make this available to you or not . Popular opinion states that the GPS mapping of Malta isn &apos;t altogether that accurate , where certain routes planned on the GPS , will send you up 1 way streets without warning , best to use common sense in conjunction with this technology .
There is the regular ferry service &#91; 13 &#93; between Ċirkewwa on Malta and Mġarr on Gozo , it goes every 45 minutes in the summer and almost as often in the winter .
You buy a return ticket at the Malta end for about € 4.70 . There are also irregular services to Comino .
Scheduled helicopter service between Malta and Gozo has been terminated .
Renting a bike in Malta is a very common and popular practice .
It doesn &apos;t cost much , but offers enough flexibility to explore .
Distinctly Maltese cuisine is hard to find but does exist .
The food eaten draws its influences from Italian cuisine .
Most restaurants in resort areas like Sliema cater largely to British tourists , offering pub grub like meat and three veg or bangers and mash , and you have to go a little out of the way to find &apos; real &apos; Maltese food . One of the island &apos;s specialities is rabbit ( fenek ) , and small savoury pastries known as pastizzi are also ubiquitous .
True Maltese food is quite humble in nature , and rather fish and vegetable based -- the kind of food that would have been available to a poor farmer , fisherman or mason . Thus one would find staples like soppa ta &apos; l ##AT##-##AT## armla ( widow &apos;s soup ) which is basically a coarse mash of whatever vegetables are in season , cooked in a thick tomato stock .
Maltese sausage is incredibly versatile and delicious . It can be eaten raw ( the pork is salted despite appearances ) , dried or roasted .
A good plan is to try it as part of a Maltese platter , increasingly available in tourist restaurants . Sun dried tomatoes and bigilla with water biscuits are also excellent .
Towards the end of summer one can have one &apos;s fill of fried lampuki ( dolphin fish ) in tomato and caper sauce ( see here for the peculiar method of catching this fish : &#91; 15 &#93; . One must also try to have a bite of ħobż biż ##AT##-##AT## żejt , which is leavened Maltese bread , cut into thick chunks , or else baked unleavened ftira , and served drenched in oil .
The bread is then spread with a thick layer of strong tomato paste , and topped ( or filled ) with olives tuna , sun ##AT##-##AT## dried tomatoes , capers , and the optional arjoli ( which in its simpler form is called ġardiniera ) .
A typical soft drink that originated in Malta is Kinnie , a non ##AT##-##AT## alcoholic fizzy drink made from bitter oranges and slightly reminiscent of Martini .
For foreigners work is unfortunately often very hard to find , the Maltese are rather insular and figures show that even in the tourist sector they are very reluctant to hire people not from the island .
There is a sense that since joining the EU there is more willingness to hire professionals from abroad as the business sector diversifies .
Malta is generally safe compared to it &apos;s European counterparts .
However , with growing illegal immigration in detention camps located in the south of the Island , locals are beginning to feel a sense of uncertainty in regards to their safety in these areas .
The main health risk in Malta is the fierce sun in the summer , which can scorch unsuspecting tourists .
For ambulance , fire or police dial 112 . The main hospitals are Mater Dei Telephone : ( + 356 ) 2545 0000 and Gozo General Hospital in Gozo , tel .
2156 1600 . For a complete list of government hospital services visit &#91; 19 &#93; .

Niger ( pronounced : NEE ##AT##-##AT## zhair ) is an arid , landlocked West African country with a population of 12 million .
It is bordered by Algeria , Mali , Burkina Faso , Benin , Nigeria , Chad and Libya . Niger is a former French colony which was granted independence in 1960 .
The land is mostly desert plains and dunes , with rolling savanna in the southeast .
Not until 1993 , 35 years after independence from France , did Niger hold its first free and open elections .
A 1995 peace accord ended a five ##AT##-##AT## year Tuareg insurgency in the north .
Coups in 1996 and 1999 were followed by the creation of a National Reconciliation Council that effected a transition to civilian rule by December 1999 .
The 50 % devaluation of the West African franc in January 1994 boosted exports of livestock , cowpeas , onions , and the products of Niger &apos;s small cotton industry . The government relies on bilateral and multilateral aid - which was suspended following the April 1999 coup d &apos;etat - for operating expenses and public investment .
There are a few private companies and one mission aviation group ( SIMAir ) that do charter flights from Niamey in small planes .
Travelers can get to Niger overland by roads from Mali , Burkina Faso , Benin and Nigeria . Some adventurous souls still cross the Sahara from the north ( Algeria ) , but that area is not secure .
There are no railways in Niger .
The country has 27 airports / landing strips , 9 of which with paved runways .
From mid ##AT##-##AT## December to March the Niger River is navigable for about 300 km , from Niamey to Gaya on the Benin border .
See the Niamey section and the Balleyara section for sample prices of these goods and where to find them .
ATMs - Mastercard / Maestro withdrawals are available at Banque Atlantique in Niamey .
Careful of the salads - usually not ok for western travelers even in the city .
Keep in mind that drinking alcohol is generally forbidden in Muslim culture , so take extra care to keep drunken inappropriate behavior behind closed doors and out of the public eye .
The only other locally produced beer is a franchise of the French West ##AT##-##AT## African Flag brewery . While taste is in the eye of the beerholder , Biere Niger is decent .
Both are brewed in the same tank from the same ingredients with the slightest variation on how much reconstituted malt they put in each batch . All other beer , boxed wine , and hard liquor is imported .
In rare pockets of the capital you can find millet beer homebrew , brewed by Burkinabe immigrants . This is drunk out of calabash gourd bowls .
Safety depends on the water quality : generally ok in the capital and NOT ok in rural areas . They are sold either sold by women out of their houses ( ask around ) , by young girls from trays on their heads , or by young boys pushing around coolers .
If you haven &apos;t learned it before you went to Niger , you probably will .
Be sure to replenish your salts as well as liquids .

Prior to European settlement in the area , the peninsula that now contains San Francisco was home to the Yelamu tribe , who were part of the larger Ohlone language group which stretched south from the Bay Area to the Big Sur of California .
Due to San Francisco &apos;s characteristic foggy weather , the earliest European explorers completely bypassed the Golden Gate and the San Francisco Bay .
The first European settlement in the area was founded by the Spaniards in 1776 as a mission community surrounding the Mission San Francisco de Asís , in what is today called the Mission Dolores in the Mission District .
San Francisco International , + 1 800 435 ##AT##-##AT## 9736 , &#91; 4 &#93; ( IATA : SFO ) located about 10 mi ( 16 km ) south of the city is a major international airport , one of the largest in the world and has numerous passenger amenities including a wide range of food and drink establishments , shopping , baggage storage , public showers , a medical clinic , and assistance for lost or stranded travelers and military personnel .
Oakland International , + 1 510 563 ##AT##-##AT## 3300 , &#91; 5 &#93; ( IATA : OAK ) in the East Bay provides service to numerous destinations in the United States as well as Mexico . It is a major hub for Southwest airlines .
Norman Y.Mineta San Jose International , + 1 408 277 ##AT##-##AT## 4759 , &#91; 6 &#93; ( IATA : SJC ) in Silicon Valley , about 1 hour south of San Francisco attracts Bay Area residents who find SFO to be inconveniently distant from their homes . Only Mexicana Airlines operates international flights from here .
The California Zephyr &#91; 14 &#93; runs daily between Chicago and Emeryville with connections to / from the east coast .
The Coast Starlight &#91; 15 &#93; runs daily between Seattle , Portland , Emeryville , and Los Angeles . To reach San Francisco , either transfer to Caltrain in San Jose or to the Amtrak bus in Emeryville .
The Capitol Corridor &#91; 16 &#93; runs 16 times daily ( 11 on weekends and holidays ) between Sacramento and Emeryville , with some trains also serving San Jose .
Caltrain ( see below ) is the best bet to get between San Jose and San Francisco , but the most convenient transfer to San Francisco is via the Amtrak bus at Emeryville or to BART at either the Richmond station north of Emeryville or the Oakland Coliseum station for trains continuing south of Emeryville . Discount BART tickets can be purchased in the cafe car .
The San Joaquins &#91; 17 &#93; runs 4 times daily between Bakersfield , Stockton and Emeryville .

Grant from Bush to Broadway takes you through the heart of the famous district .
Returning by the parallel Stockton or Powell will give you a better feeling of the day to day life of the residents , and are both good for those looking for imported commodities such as tea or herbs .
Ocean Beach is entirely open to pedestrians in both the Richmond and Sunset districts from the Cliff House restaurant and Sutro Baths in the north to the zoo in the south . For a shorter walk , the windmills near Lincoln at the end of Golden Gate Park offer a good base for a stroll north .
Telegraph Hill . Greenwich and Filbert Steps on the east side of Telegraph Hill , both strenuous and unforgettably beautiful , offer cottages and a flock of wild parrots to enjoy on the way up to the Coit Tower .
Columbus runs from North Point in Fisherman &apos;s Wharf , through the grand church and famous cafés at the heart of North Beach to the landmark Transamerica pyramid , accessible to transit on nearby Market .
Haight Ashbury . Haight from Divisadero to Stanyan covers the shopping district famous for hippie culture ; at Stanyan the street becomes a path through Golden Gate Park to a popular site ( then and now ) for relaxing and concerts .
Union Street between Gough and Fillmore is one of the finest shopping streets outside of the city center .
Mission between 15th and Cesar Chavez streets provides a look at a neighborhood famous for its Latino food and culture , as well as occasional gang activity ; women alone should be careful here at night .
Parallel to Mission , Valencia Street is the artery of the many higher end boutiques and offbeat cafés starting to characterize the neighborhood , and has little of the grit of Mission St.
Pacific Heights . Fillmore between Pine and Broadway is lined with a good mix of shopping , views , steep slopes , and some of the city ’ s largest and most expensive homes .
Fillmore . Post from Laguna ( near 38 bus stop ) to Fillmore takes you through upscale shopping and restaurants in Japantown , and turning left onto Fillmore across Geary and on to Turk takes you past the internationally known jazz venue and a mix of Black and Korean owned shops .
Muni - streetcars , metro , buses and cable cars within San Francisco city .
BART - regional rail services across the Bay Area .
The Historic Streetcar F Line uses historic streetcars , in original colors from several cities in the US and Milan , Italy .
The line runs from Fisherman &apos;s Wharf south along the waterfront Embarcadero to the ferry building at the foot of Market Street , then up Market Street on the surface to the Castro district .
Board through the front door and buy tickets from the driver if you do not already have a transfer or pass .
The world ##AT##-##AT## famous Cable Cars run on three lines in the steep streets between Market Street and Fisherman &apos;s Wharf : the north ##AT##-##AT## south Powell ##AT##-##AT## Mason and Powell ##AT##-##AT## Hyde lines and the east ##AT##-##AT## west California Street line . These cars are a fun ride , especially if you get to stand on the running board , if a bit impractical for everyday use ( though residents of Nob and Russian Hills do , in fact , use them on a daily basis ) .
Both diesel and electric buses serve the rest of city .
Board through the front door and buy tickets from or show your pass or transfer to the driver .
Service ranges from a consistent two minutes on many lines leaving Market , to a more sporadic 20 minutes for buses to Treasure Island and between outlying neighborhoods .
Bus delays , leading to waits of 20 to 30 minutes , are not uncommon and are a source of much grousing among locals .
MUNI operates the bus service 24 hours day / seven days a week in San Francisco although late night owl service is limited in both lines and stops .
BART , the regional metro , has eight stations in San Francisco , making it a nice way to get between well ##AT##-##AT## trafficked parts of the city , especially downtown and the Mission . BART gets you across the Bay to Berkeley and Oakland and to the airports of San Francisco and Oakland .
Outer stations in far outlying suburbs have a maximum wait of fifteen to twenty minutes between BART Trains . After 12 : 30AM , AC Transit and other east bay transit providers provide overnight bus service , serving principal BART stations until about 6AM .
BART trains operate on a two track system ( one inbound and one outbound ) . Train routes are named for the two terminus cities , not for the line color as denoted on the system map .
Other than the 4th and King terminal in SoMa , these are the 22nd St. Station and the Bayshore Station ( off of Tunnel Ave ) , neither of which are particularly attractive for visitors . Of interest to visitors who wish to travel outside of city is the Palo Alto Station ( at University Avenue ) , across the street from the campus of Stanford University , and San Jose Diridon Station .
If you have strong legs and can tolerate traffic with intermittent bike lanes , bicycles can be a convenient form of transportation in San Francisco . The city is fairly small -- about 7 miles on each side ( 11 km ) -- and it &apos;s fairly quick to get from one end to the other .
Do not be misled by maps depicting the city &apos;s strict , regular street grid , as even the straightest of San Francisco &apos;s streets might include steep hills or even staircases instead of a roadway . A classic and relatively easy ride is from the tip of Golden Gate Park ’ s narrow Panhandle in the Haight , along paths and JFK Drive through the park to Ocean Beach .
Taxis in San Francisco are , for a large city , surprisingly inefficient and expensive , starting at $ 3.10 just for getting in the door . You can get an idea of how much particular taxi trips cost in San Francisco using the San Francisco Taxicab Commission &apos;s webpage &#91; 43 &#93; .
Perpetually ##AT##-##AT## clogged traffic , steep hills , a confusing system of one ##AT##-##AT## way streets downtown , expensive parking , and a fleet of parking control officers who enforce parking laws with zeal can make driving in San Francisco extremely frustrating ; visitors to the city should seriously consider alternatives to automobiles when possible .
In addition , traffic from the Golden Gate Bridge uses surface streets either along CA ##AT##-##AT## 1 , 19th Avenue or US ##AT##-##AT## 101 on Lombard and Van Ness .
The greatest hazard of driving is on Lombard Street between Hyde and Leavenworth , where a stretch known as &quot; The Crookedest Street in the World &quot; runs one ##AT##-##AT## way down a steep hill making eight hairpin turns .
Oversized vehicles such as pickup trucks , sport utility vehicles , and recreational vehicles should NOT attempt to pass through the winding stretch of Lombard Street .
Cross streets . As San Francisco streets are numbered ( 100 per block ) from the beginning of the street , and even and odd numbers are always on opposite sides , it is best when asking directions to ask for a cross street or neighborhood name .
For instance , if you are at the intersection of Haight Street and Clayton Street , and you ask the driver of the 33 Stanyan bus &quot; Does this bus go to Market Street ?
&quot; it will get you a yes , but the bus won &apos;t get you downtown , it will get you south from that intersection to Market and 18th in the Castro district .
One of the most confusing aspects of driving in San Francisco is the presence of multiple street grids , particularly in the downtown area where two grids intersect at an angle along Market Street .
Even more confusing are streets in the middle of the standard blocks , like New Montgomery Street .
A relatively cheap and easy way to cover many attractions of the city is the CityPass .
For a fare of $ 59 for adults and $ 39 for children 17 and under , you get admission to the California Academy of Sciences , a Blue and Gold Fleet bay cruise , the Aquarium of the Bay , the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art ( SFMOMA ) , and the Exploratorium or the Legion of Honor and the de Young Museum ( both must be visited on the same day ) .
A City Pass works for 9 consecutive days starting with the use of your first ticket ( each ticket only accounts for one visit to each attraction ) .
The pass also includes seven consecutive days of Cable Car and MUNI fares .
Another easy way to cover many attractions and tours is the Go San Francisco Card .
This card allows you to take some tours for free , such as the Wine Country tour , San Francisco Sightseeing , City Tour , Bay Cruises , museums , aquariums , The Conservatory of Flowers , and many other activities .
Other tours and activities are also discounted from $ 5 to 40 % .
The cost of the card is $ 50 for 1 day , $ 80 for 2 days , $ 85 for 3 days .
$ 115 for 5 days , and $ 136 for 7 days .
If you are visiting Fisherman &apos;s Wharf this pass includes 10 attractions , bay cruises and sightseeing tours .
With the pass you have 2 days to enjoy a Hop On Hop Off Tour of San Francisco , Bay Cruise under the Golden Gate Bridge and choice of 3 of 6 attractions .
The 2 day pass includes additional discounts at 45 Wharf area shopping , dining , activity and tour companies .
The cost for the Wharf Pass is $ 58 for adults and $ 38 for children 5 ##AT##-##AT## 11 .
The Wharf Pass can be combined with an Alcatraz ferry and audio tour by contacting Alcatraz Cruises reservation department at + 1 415 981 ##AT##-##AT## 7625 &#91; 49 &#93; .
The Golden Gate Bridge , located at the Golden Gate , is perhaps the most recognizable landmark in San Francisco and one of the most famous bridges in the United States , and has been called one of the Seven Wonders of the Modern World .
The bridge spans the Golden Gate , a strait between San Francisco and Marin County to the north , and is one of the major road routes into and out of the city .
The famous cable cars run up and down the hills of San Francisco between Market Street and Fisherman &apos;s Wharf and offer quite a ride .
See above under Get around for more info .
The Presidio , located in the Golden Gate district , was founded in 1776 and was the longest ##AT##-##AT## running military post in the U.S. before closing as a base in 1994 .
It is now a part of the Golden Gate National Recreation Area and contains the Fort Point National Historic Site .
From its vantage point overlooking the spectacular Golden Gate , Fort Point protected San Francisco harbor from Confederate and foreign attack during and after the U.S. Civil War .
Its beautifully arched casemates display the art of the master brick masons from the Civil War period .
The Palace of Fine Arts is a beautiful building , built for the 1915 Panama ##AT##-##AT## Pacific Exposition and reminiscent of Roman and Greek architecture .
Coit Tower , atop Telegraph Hill in North Beach , is dedicated to the San Francisco firefighters ( who fought a massive blaze in 1906 after the earthquake that destroyed much of the city center ) , and the tower is rumored to be designed to resemble the nozzle of a fire hose .
At 250 &apos; high , it is a healthy hike from the nearby neighborhoods just below the hill .
The Transamerica Pyramid is the tallest and most recognizable building in the San Francisco skyline , located among the skyscrapers and highrises of the Financial District .
Alamo Square Park in the Western Addition district is home to the famous Painted Ladies row of Victorian houses on its east side along Steiner Street , with many other pretty Victorians encircling the lovely park .
Fisherman &apos;s Wharf is a great place to see amazing street entertainers , eat excellent seafood , watch sea lions , visit museums , or take a cruise to the infamous Alcatraz Prison or the pleasant Angel Island .
Working fishing boats still come into the small harbor at Jones and Jefferson , the endpoint of the Muni Historic F ##AT##-##AT## streetcar .
There are also small day and party boats available .
The fresh breeze from the bay can provide a bracing setting .
Chinatown , centered around Grant Street from Bush to Columbus , is part tourist trap , part an exhibit of local life . Good eating places remain , and the side streets especially have stores one wouldn &apos;t find in a mall .
Stockton Street , the street paralleling Grant to the west , is the main street where most locals do their shopping for groceries . Be sure to sample some of the dim sum and other specialties offered in the many bustling shops .
Even on a sunny day the bay can be chilly , so be sure to bring a sweater as well as sun screen .
Some boats have snack bars on board , but bring your own water and treats to avoid paying high costs or going without . There are now limited refreshments and a souvenirs shop on Alcatraz .
San Francisco has a Half ##AT##-##AT## Price Ticket Booth located right in the middle of Union Square , where tickets for most San Francisco theater performances can be purchased the day of the performance for half ##AT##-##AT## price .
Run by Theatre Bay Area &#91; 67 &#93; , all service fees collected from the sale of tickets by TIX Bay Area &#91; 68 &#93; goes right back into the theater community .

Also in the University of California system is the Hastings College of the Law , a major law school located in downtown San Francisco .
The San Francisco State University is another major public university that offers a broader range of studies than the UC colleges in the city . Rounding off the city &apos;s public colleges is the City College of San Francisco , a two ##AT##-##AT## year community college .
San Francisco also has numerous private colleges and universities , some of them large , such as the University of San Francisco located in the Richmond district , and some of them smaller and much more specalized .
Being the world ##AT##-##AT## class tourist attraction that it is , San Francisco &apos;s economy is mostly centered on tourism .
Its frequent portrayal in music , films , literature and popular culture has helped make the city and its landmarks known throughout the world .
San Francisco has developed a large tourist infrastructure with numerous hotels , restaurants , and top ##AT##-##AT## notch convention facilities .
While it &apos;s been a long time since people considered Montgomery Street in the Financial District to be the &quot; Wall Street of the West &quot; , San Francisco remains one of the principal banking and finance centers of the west coast of the United States .
Many major financial institutions and banks are based in the city or have set up regional headquarters here .
San Francisco &apos;s proximity to Silicon Valley has made the city increasingly attractive for high ##AT##-##AT## tech companies .
In recent years , San Francisco has also been making itself a center of biotechnology .
See the Districts articles for more listings .
San Francisco has a wide range of small and locally ##AT##-##AT## owned businesses throughout the neighborhoods of the city .
In fact , San Francisco has for the most part repelled the development of large chain retailers and big box stores that are common across America .
Fisherman &apos;s Wharf has all your typical touristy souvenir shops and a few small shopping centers .
Union Square has many national retailers and fancy boutique stores , as well as a few shopping centers thrown in to the mix .
Sushi is a local obsession , and though you can find a sushi bar on almost every street corner , the Richmond district has more than its fair share of excellent sushi chefs . San Francisco also has the largest Chinatown in North America , as well as one of the largest Chinese communities in the West , and many exceptional restaurants serving dim sum and other Chinese delicacies are found throughout The City .
The best way to find a good bar or club is to ask the advice of a local ; but barring that a copy of The SF Bay Guardian or the SF Weekly will help you find something suited to your personal taste .
If you like soccer ( football ) and all things English , you should stop into the Kezar Pub , at the edge of the Haight ##AT##-##AT## Ashbury District , or Lower Haight &apos; s Mad Dog In the Fog .

Good for an entire day &apos;s worth of drinking .

Many of these are accessible by BART . And although Santa Rosa is 45 minutes north of San Francisco , no beer lovers should skip the renowned Russian River Brewing Company in downtown Santa Rosa .
The area code for San Francisco is 415 . You need to only dial the seven digit phone number for calls within the city .
For calls within the US or Canada , dial 1 + area code + number , and for international calls , dial 011 + country code + city code ( if applicable ) + number .
Pay phones are getting less and less commonplace as nearly everyone in San Francisco has a mobile phone .
When you do find one , keep in mind that they only take coins and phone cards with a dial ##AT##-##AT## to ##AT##-##AT## use number . Local calls start at $ 0.50 .
Gang violence touches even busy and thriving areas such as the Mission street retail corridor , although most instances of violent crime are directed to specific targets and are not random acts . The SoMa district used to be somewhat dangerous ; however , recent gentrification ( something that has become fairly common and a social issue in SF ) has transformed it into a rather hip and much safer neighborhood with plenty of art galleries and clubs .
The main homeless area is around 6th and Market , heading towards the Civic Center , and in the Tenderloin . Haight Ashbury also has lots of panhandlers , and the area near Golden Gate Park at the end of Haight Street near McDonalds is notorious for junkies and should be avoided at night .
San Francisco is renowned for its openness to diversity in race , gender , sexual orientations and personal style . This trait is widely considered to be one of the defining features of the city , and it draws both visitors and transplants alike .
Oakland — A diverse and vibrant city , Oakland was once considered San Francisco &apos;s &quot; sister city , &quot; and has been regaining that title in recent years due to a growing economy and a general renaissance of the city .
It &apos;s worth a visit for its many distinct and charming neighborhoods .
Alice Waters ’ French ##AT##-##AT## inspired Chez Panisse is in the north of the city , and is often listed as one of the best restaurants in the world , offering regional and seasonal organic food prepared simply but skillfully .

About 633,000 people live in the city proper , with about 725,000 in the entire metropolitan area . &quot; The Peg &quot; is a city as diverse in and of itself as the whole of Canada .
However , this pedestrian ##AT##-##AT## unfriendliness is primarily perceived rather than real . Virtually all streets contain sidewalks on both sides running for the street &apos;s entire length , and stoplight crossings are frequent even on highways .

With 60 fps , the monochrome astronomy camera DMK 21AU04.AS is the fastest within its category .
It is ideally suited to black and white astrophotography , in which very fast image sequences are captured .
Using the shipped software - IC Capture.AS - you can capture lossless and uncompressed images sequences as AVI files .
The astro CCD camera DMK 21AU04.AS uses the monochrome progressive scan CCD ICX098BL from Sony ® .
With its 1 / 4 &quot; format , the CCD produces a resolution of 640 x 480 pixels .
Even at long exposure times , its noise is minimal .
Thanks to its unsurpassed quality , the ICX098BL is often used in industrial image processing applications .
The CCD camera DMK 21AU04.AS does not use compression , nor does it have an IR cut filter , a color filter or an electronic filter .
Thus , the camera produces very true ##AT##-##AT## to ##AT##-##AT## life captures of the night sky .
The astronomy camera DMK 21AU04.AS generates a high rate of uncompressed monochrome images .
In order to transfer these to the host PC , a very fast bus is required . Hence , the camera is fitted with a USB 2.0 connector .
This camera ships with the camera driver IC WDM DCAM TIS and the control software IC Capture.AS.
Below are sample images and &apos; in action &apos; images of astronomy cameras ( click to enlarge ) .

The number of new viruses and malware is increasing continually .
The AntiVir products supply such a professional virus and malware protection through a so ##AT##-##AT## called virus definition file , which is updated several times a day .
Update for : Unicode ##AT##-##AT## aware Products of Avira Antivir Windows Professional , Avira AntiVir Premium , Avira Premium Security Suite and Avira AntiVir Personal - Free Antivirus on Windows XP , 2000 and Windows Vista .
All Avira virus definition files ( VDFs ) and the Avira search engine are thoroughly tested before they are made available on the download servers .
This test period does of course broaden the time span between putting new detection patterns into the VDF or new exploits into the engine and their publication .
However , there might be certain scenarios in which it is primarily important to get the most recent VDFs and engine versions as early as possible .
For such cases Avira provides untested , so called Beta ##AT##-##AT## VDFs and Beta ##AT##-##AT## Engine versions for downloading .
Detects and removes distinct malware and its variants .
Thank you for a good time to you .

Mausolus was well established in his new capital by 367 BC , and before the end of his reign he ruled from here over a kingdom that included all of Caria and considerable portions of Ionia and Lycia , as well as the islands of Rhodes , Cos , and Chios .
Mausolos taxed his inhabitants heavily to pay for these and other grand scale projects , and it is said that he even imposed a levy on hair longer then shoulder length .
Spread on both banks of the Elbe , the city of Kolín lies in the fertile Elbe lowlands .
Rich archaeologic finds in and around the city brought to light numerous artifacts witnessing all known past cultures on Bohemian territory .
The place was a junction of three important merchant &apos;s trails back in the Roman times , many excavated coins , as old as from the Classical times , prove .
The middle of the l3th century brought an order by Přemysl Otakar II to fortify Kolín with walls , the latin record made by the royal scribe says .
The oldest document with the name of Kolín in it bears thé date of 1261 .
The Kings Charles IV and Wenceslas IV gave the town many privileges to promote the growth of the city and its citizen &apos;s wealth .
At that time , Kolín &apos;s position was prominent among the cities of the Crown , in size as well as in importance .
The harshest humiliation and poverty ever seen came during the 30 ##AT##-##AT## Year War , the period of constant siege and plundering .
June 18 , 1757 , saw one of the bloodiest clashes of the 7 ##AT##-##AT## year Prussian ##AT##-##AT## Austrian War close to the town .
This Battle of Kolín imposed a defeat on Fridrich I by Maria Theresia &apos;s troops , after which the Prussians had to clear Prague and withdraw from Bohemia .
The early l8th century National Revival was beneficial to Kolín , the first bastion of the patriotic rush .
Industry and trade were given a new impetus by the 1845 railway , too .
In 1869 , the streets of Kolín got gas lamps and the North ##AT##-##AT## Western Railway commenced in 1872 .
The development was later hindered by the two World Wars .
But the intermediate period saw the city and its industries expand enormously .
1927 gave the city a new bridge across the Elbe and 1932 added the first calorific power plant .
The city &apos;s heart has been preserved in the Charles Square in its original layout and proud of the many baroque gables .
The centrepoint is the 1780 fountain and the 1682 Plague Post .
The town hall in one corner is worth the attention especially due to the ceiling paintings in the big hall and gallery as well as the three paintings by Václav Radimský .
The skyline is dominated by the late ##AT##-##AT## l3th ##AT##-##AT## century Gothic St Bartholomew &apos;s Cathedral .
The magnificence of the two octagonal towers and the square belfry , the work of Petr Parléř , have been ruling over the place for centuries .
Remainders of the Jewish Ghetto , the synagogue and the old Jewish Cemetery are worth mentioning as well .
Numerous prominent celebrities were born , lived or worked here .
The list of famous natives shows names like Jean Gaspard Deburau , colossus of world pantomime , painters Vincenc Morstadt and Rudolf Kremlička , photographer Josef Sudek , poets Svatopluk Machar and Karel Leger , actress Terezie Brzková and the world ##AT##-##AT## famous operatic cantatrice Ludmila Dvořáková .
There is one personality who made Kolín famous worldwide : the composer and conductor František Kmoch whose memory is an acoustic one - the annual festival of brass ##AT##-##AT## band music called &quot; Kmochův Kolín &quot; .

This a very nice 4 stars hotel for 200 € + extra that I paid . But I wouldn &apos;t pay the 450 € foreseen price for this very classic ...
This is unexpectedly and unlikely providing the spacious rooms for the guests with the very reasonable price , even if it is located in the city of Paris .
I will like this hotel at my next chance to visit Paris .
We stayed last year for my husbands 60th birthday and enjoyed it so much we decided to come back this year , for about the same rate breakfast was included in the price , this year it was not included , when we enquired why , the reception staff told us it was because we booked through a differant tour operator , this is not good customer service and has made us think twice about coming back .

It &apos;s a histoic chateau located on a well manicured property 10 km from Bayeaux in Normandy . The rooms are filled with collectables and the service is good .
Also , close proximity to Omaha beach and the American WWII Memorial and Cemetary was great . Monsieur Vallee ( the owner ) recommended a wonderful restaurant for dinner in the town of Bayeux .
Language was a difficulty even though I speak enough French to get us by in most circumstances .
I had imagined there would be a restaurant after a tiring day we had to drive into Bayeux for a meal.Communication breakdown over breakfast , didn &apos;t realise only option was in room &amp; we didn &apos;t order night before .
Some written info in room would have been useful .
liked that it was an unusual place to stay .
In England this would be rated as a Bed and Breakfast guest house .
In fact we were staying in a family home . Had to have breakfast in our room .

Great location which was close to everything you really want to see in Edinburgh .
While the location was close to everything , the building was in an alley and the building was less than desirable . The beds only came with a thin blanket and had no extra comforters .
Brilliant apartment , great location on a cool street , very roomy and comfortable and clean . All in all we were delighted - so much better ( and cheaper !
The apartment needs to be refurbished .
The beds were not comfortable . The water in the shower was either hot or cold .
We did not manage to fix the temperature of the water .
That was especially bad for our children .
cant comment on staff as we stayed in an apartment .
Lots of history around us and quiet in the evening ( apart from the traffic on the cobbled street outside !
Two lights were not working ( bedroom and lamp in lounge ) .
Away from main centre and uphill to get there . Quite a way from the trainm station .
1 ) Office not at place indicated in email . Had to walk rather far to find it .
Then found out that hotel itself was even further away , in the opposite direction . 2 ) The keys were very hard to use , we had to wait for someone to open from inside .
The location was quite OK . The apartment was really clean and comfortable and big enough for 4 people .

made us feel very welcome , child friendly .
some human hair , bathroom , bedside cabinet , and a curly one stuck to phone . ( didnt say anything ) was tidy next day .
Proximity to Bristol Business Park . Good breakfast .
Although I had booked a twin room on line and specified it in the comments box we were allocated a double .As I was staying with my teenage son this was not acceptable .
I was told that there were no twin rooms , unfortunately the receptionist spoke little English and had to get assistance .
Unforunatetly we did not have a good stay , mix up with booking ( their fault ) meant 1 room booked , instead of 2 , hence no adjoing room as requested . Very Very noisy rooms - louts in rooms either side ( football team ) no sleep had until well passed 2am .
Weekend spoiled by tiredness . I had asked for quiet rooms , but because of mix up I feel we were put in last available rooms near each other .
Very good , enjoyed the hotel and the facilities it felt like I was on holiday and I was .

Nice clean and comfortable rooms , in a good location for the city . Staff were pleasant and friendly .
We thought the hotel was great for our night stay . We came down for a party at Delia &apos;s it was very nice and very close to the centre .
It would have been better to have 4 bath &amp; 4 hand towels in the room , already . We had to ring down in the middle of our baths , as we didn &apos;t expect to only have 2 for 4 people .
Dedicated car parking very close to the hotel , friendly and helpful staff .

Just next to the train station and only a couple of mins walk from the centre of the town .
Even internet in the rooms was outrageously priced , as was the hotel bar . There is no reason for this !
The hotel has beautiful gardens and grounds around it . It was very clean and the staff were helpful .
There is a new build on the hotel seperate from the historic building . I think they should tell you previous to arriving if you are in here to avoid dissopointment .
The beds were not particularly comfortable and the room was very warm .
from my expectations of this hotel it must have been very grand in its past life , shame its lost some of that .
but a pleasurable experience and one i will look for
